        <h2>What is Blues?</h2>
        <p>
          Blues, emerging in the late 19th century from African-American communities in the Deep South, is a soulful genre 
          expressing hardship, love, and resilience. With its emotive vocals and guitar riffs, as in Muddy Waters’ <em>Hoochie 
          Coochie Man</em>, blues captures raw human experience. It’s the foundation of many modern genres.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its heartfelt sound continues to resonate across generations and borders.

        <h2>Origins and Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          Blues grew from spirituals, work songs, and field hollers in the Mississippi Delta. By the 1920s, artists like Bessie 
          Smith popularized classic blues. The 1940s Chicago electric blues, led by Howlin’ Wolf, amplified the sound.
          B.B. King’s <em>Lucille</em> brought blues to mainstream audiences, influencing rock, jazz, and R&B.

          This evolution reflects blues’ journey from rural roots to global impact.

          Blues features a 12-bar structure, mournful melodies, and blue notes that bend pitch for emotion. Guitar slides, 
          harmonicas, and call-and-response vocals, as in <em>Sweet Home Chicago</em>, create its distinctive sound.
          Lyrics often explore struggle and redemption, delivered with raw intensity or subtle nuance.
