        <h2>What is Classical Music?</h2>
        <p>
          Classical Music, spanning roughly from the 17th to 19th centuries, encompasses orchestral, chamber, and vocal works 
          known for their complexity and emotional depth. Composers like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, and 
          Johann Sebastian Bach crafted masterpieces, such as Mozart’s <em>Symphony No. 40</em>, that remain cultural 
          cornerstones. This genre emphasizes structure, harmony, and expressive melodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its timeless appeal continues to inspire musicians and audiences worldwide, bridging centuries with its universal 
          language.

        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>
          Classical Music evolved through distinct periods: Baroque, Classical, and Romantic. The Baroque era, led by Bach, 
          featured intricate counterpoint, as in <em>Brandenburg Concertos</em>. The Classical period, with Haydn and Mozart, 
          prioritized clarity and balance. The Romantic era, epitomized by Beethoven’s <em>Symphony No. 9</em>, embraced 
          emotional intensity. These shifts reflect changing societal values, from royal courts to public concert halls.
        </p>
        <p>
          This evolution highlights music’s role in mirroring cultural and intellectual movements.

          Bach’s precise compositions, like <em>Toccata and Fugue in D Minor</em>, laid technical foundations. Mozart’s operas, 
          such as <em>The Marriage of Figaro</em>, blended drama and melody. Beethoven’s innovative symphonies, including 
          <em>Eroica</em>, pushed musical boundaries, influencing future genres. Other giants, like Vivaldi with <em>The Four 
          Seasons</em>, added vivid storytelling through sound.

        <h2>Musical Forms and Techniques</h2>
        <p>
          Classical Music features diverse forms: symphonies for large orchestras, sonatas for solo instruments, and concertos 
          highlighting virtuosos. Techniques like thematic development, where motifs evolve, create narrative depth, as in 
          Beethoven’s <em>Fifth Symphony</em>. Counterpoint and harmony, perfected by Bach, add richness. These elements demand 
          precision from performers and captivate listeners with their intricacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such techniques showcase the genre’s intellectual and emotional power.

        <p>
          Classical Music shaped cultural identity, from aristocratic salons to modern concert halls. It inspired literature, 
          film scores, and even pop music, with Beethoven’s motifs echoing in contemporary works. Educational programs teach its 
          discipline, while performances foster community. Its universal themes—love, struggle, triumph—resonate across cultures, 
          making it a vital part of global heritage.
