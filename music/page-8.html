          Electronic Music, emerging in the 20th century, uses synthesizers, computers, and digital tools to create innovative 
          sounds. From Kraftwerk’s pioneering <em>Autobahn</em> to Daft Punk’s <em>Random Access Memories</em>, it spans genres 
          like techno, house, and EDM, redefining music with its futuristic, dance-driven energy.

        <p>
          Electronic Music began with early experiments like the theremin and musique concrète in the 1940s. The 1970s saw 
          Kraftwerk’s synth-driven sound influence disco and hip-hop. The 1980s birthed house in Chicago and techno in Detroit, 
          while the 1990s rave scene, led by The Prodigy, globalized EDM. Today, artists like Skrillex push boundaries with 
          dubstep.
