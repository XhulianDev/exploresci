        <h2>What is Opera?</h2>
        <p>
          Opera, born in the late 16th century, is a theatrical art form combining music, singing, and drama. Composers like 
          Giuseppe Verdi and Giacomo Puccini created masterpieces such as Verdi’s <em>La Traviata</em>, where powerful arias and
          orchestras tell stories of love, tragedy, and triumph. It’s a grand fusion of voice and spectacle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its emotional intensity captivates audiences, transcending time and language.

        <h2>Origins and Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          Opera began in Italy with Monteverdi’s <em>Orfeo</em>, blending Renaissance ideals with storytelling. The Baroque era 
          saw Handel’s elaborate works, while the 19th century brought Romantic operas by Wagner and Bizet’s <em>Carmen</em>. 
          Modern operas, like Philip Glass’s <em>Einstein on the Beach</em>, experiment with minimalism, keeping the form
          vibrant.
        </p>
        <p>
          This evolution reflects opera’s adaptability to cultural shifts.

          Mozart’s <em>The Magic Flute</em> blended humor and mysticism. Verdi’s <em>Aida</em> showcased epic drama. Puccini’s 
          <em>La Bohème</em> captured raw emotion. Wagner’s <em>Ring Cycle</em> redefined scale and myth. Contemporary voices
          like Maria Callas and Luciano Pavarotti brought operatic roles to life with unmatched vocal power.

        <h2>Musical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          Opera features soaring arias, duets, and choruses, supported by lush orchestras. Recitatives advance the plot, while 
          leitmotifs, as in Wagner’s works, tie themes to characters. Vocal techniques, from bel canto to dramatic soprano, 
          convey intense emotion. Lavish sets and costumes enhance the storytelling experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          These elements make opera a uniquely immersive art form.
