        <h2>What is Jazz?</h2>
        <p>
          Jazz, born in the early 20th century in New Orleans, is a vibrant genre defined by improvisation, syncopated rhythms, 
          and expressive melodies. Legends like Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis shaped its sound, with classics like Armstrong’s
          <em>West End Blues</em>. Blending African-American musical traditions with blues and ragtime, jazz is a celebration of
          spontaneity and emotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its dynamic energy continues to captivate global audiences, evolving with each generation.

        <h2>Origins and Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          Jazz emerged from African-American communities, rooted in spirituals, work songs, and Creole influences. By the 1920s,
          it spread to Chicago and New York, with big bands like Duke Ellington’s dominating the Swing Era. Bebop, led by 
          Charlie Parker, introduced complex harmonies, while Cool Jazz and Fusion, pioneered by Davis’ <em>Kind of Blue</em>, 
          pushed boundaries. Today, jazz blends with hip-hop and electronic music.
        </p>
        <p>
          This evolution reflects jazz’s adaptability and cultural resonance.

        <h2>Musical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          Jazz thrives on improvisation, allowing musicians to riff on melodies in real time. Swing rhythms, blue notes, and 
          call-and-response patterns create its distinctive groove. Instruments like the saxophone, trumpet, and piano lead, 
          often in small combos or big bands. Complex chord progressions, as in bebop, challenge performers and reward
          listeners with intricate, soulful soundscapes.
        </p>
        <p>
          These elements make jazz a uniquely expressive and collaborative art form.

          Jazz broke racial barriers, uniting diverse audiences in segregated eras. It fueled cultural movements, from
          the Harlem Renaissance to civil rights, with songs like Holiday’s protest anthems. Jazz clubs became spaces for
          social exchange, while global tours spread its influence to Europe and beyond. Today, jazz education fosters 
          creativity, and festivals like Montreux celebrate its enduring community spirit.
