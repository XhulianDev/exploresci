          danceable rhythms. Rooted in rock, jazz, and folk, pop reflects the pulse of contemporary culture.

          Pop Music took shape in the 1950s with rock and roll’s rise, evolving through the 1960s with The Beatles’ melodic
          hits. The 1980s saw MTV amplify stars like Michael Jackson, whose <em>Thriller</em> redefined the genre.
          The 2000s brought digital streaming, boosting artists like Beyoncé and Adele. Today, K-pop and Latin pop, like
          Bad Bunny, globalize the sound.
