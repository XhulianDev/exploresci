        <h2>What is Music’s Role in Society?</h2>
        <p>
          Music is a universal language that shapes societal values, identities, and movements. From Bob Dylan’s <em>Blowin’ in 
          the Wind</em> fueling civil rights to Beyoncé’s <em>Formation</em> addressing racial justice, it reflects and drives 
          cultural change. Music fosters connection, whether through communal singing or global anthems, influencing how 
          communities define themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its profound impact makes music a cornerstone of human experience and social progress.

        <h2>Music and Cultural Identity</h2>
        <p>
          Music preserves and expresses cultural heritage, from Irish folk tunes to West African griot storytelling.
          It strengthens community bonds, as seen in Native American powwow drums or Brazilian samba at Carnival. Genres
          like reggae, with Bob Marley’s <em>Redemption Song</em>, embody national pride and resistance. In a globalized world, 
          music bridges cultures while celebrating unique traditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This role highlights music’s power to unify and distinguish societies.

        <h2>Music in Social Movements</h2>
        <p>
          Music has long fueled activism. Songs like <em>We Shall Overcome</em> galvanized civil rights, while punk bands like 
          The Clash protested political oppression. Hip-hop, from Public Enemy to Kendrick Lamar, confronts systemic inequality.
          Protest music, whether Woody Guthrie’s labor anthems or Chilean Nueva Canción, amplifies marginalized voices, 
          inspiring collective action and policy change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its influence underscores music’s ability to challenge and transform.

        <h2>Music and Community Building</h2>
        <p>
          Music fosters belonging, from choir rehearsals to festival crowds. Events like Woodstock or Glastonbury create shared 
          experiences, uniting diverse groups. Community music programs, like El Sistema in Venezuela, empower youth through 
          collaboration. Online platforms, from TikTok dance trends to virtual concerts, extend these connections, building 
          global communities around shared rhythms and melodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          These efforts show music’s capacity to strengthen social bonds.
        </p>

        <h2>Music’s Broader Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond culture and activism, music influences education, therapy, and economies. Music education enhances cognitive 
          skills, while therapy aids mental health, as seen in programs for veterans. The music industry, from streaming to live
          events, drives billions in revenue, shaping trends in fashion, film, and technology. Its universal appeal fosters 
          empathy, breaking down barriers across societies.
        </p>
        <p>
          This impact affirms music’s role as a catalyst for growth and connection.
