        <h2>What is Hip-Hop?</h2>
        <p>
          Hip-Hop, born in the 1970s Bronx, is a cultural movement encompassing rap, DJing, breakdancing, and graffiti.
          Its music, driven by rhythmic vocals and beats, includes classics like Run-DMC’s <em>Walk This Way</em> and
          Kendrick Lamar’s <em>Alright</em>. Rooted in African-American and Latino communities, it’s a voice for expression and 
          resistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its global influence continues to redefine art and identity.

        <h2>Origins and Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          Hip-Hop emerged at block parties with DJs like Kool Herc spinning breakbeats. The 1980s brought rap to the mainstream 
          with Public Enemy’s political anthems. The 1990s East-West rivalry, led by Tupac and Notorious B.I.G., shaped its 
          narrative. Today, artists like Drake and Nicki Minaj blend hip-hop with pop, while trap and drill expand its sound.

          This evolution reflects hip-hop’s adaptability and cultural depth.

        <p>
          Hip-Hop features looped beats, turntable scratches, and rhymed lyrics delivered with flow. Sampling, from funk to jazz
          creates rich textures, as in Kanye West’s productions. Bass-heavy drums and synths define subgenres like trap. Lyrics 
          range from storytelling to social commentary, reflecting personal and collective experiences.
        </p>
