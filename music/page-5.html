        <h2>What is Folk Music?</h2>
        <p>
          Folk Music, passed down through generations, captures the stories, struggles, and traditions of communities. From Bob 
          Dylan’s <em>Blowin’ in the Wind</em> to ancient Celtic ballads, it uses simple melodies and acoustic instruments to 
          convey universal themes of love, loss, and resilience. Rooted in oral tradition, it reflects cultural identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its timeless quality continues to connect people across cultures and eras.

        <h2>Origins and Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          Folk Music predates written history, with roots in rural communities worldwide. In the U.S., the 1960s folk revival, 
          led by Woody Guthrie and Joan Baez, tied it to social justice. Global traditions, like Balkan a cappella or 
          Appalachian banjo tunes, enriched its diversity. Today, indie folk artists like Fleet Foxes blend old and new.
        </p>
        <p>
          This evolution showcases folk’s enduring relevance and adaptability.

          scope. Pete Seeger’s protest songs inspired activism. International voices, like Ireland’s The Chieftains or
          Mali’s Ali Farka Touré, brought global folk to the world stage, preserving and innovating traditions.

        <h2>Musical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          Folk Music relies on acoustic instruments—guitar, banjo, fiddle—and straightforward melodies. Lyrics often
          tell stories, from historical events to personal tales, as in <em>Scarborough Fair</em>. Harmonies and group
          singing foster community. 
          Regional styles, like bluegrass or flamenco, add unique rhythms and scales.
        </p>
        <p>
          These traits make folk an intimate, authentic art form.

          Overcome</em>. 
          It preserves cultural heritage, teaching history through ballads. Festivals like Newport Folk unite communities,
          while folk’s influence shapes genres like country and indie. Its accessibility encourages anyone to sing and
          share stories.
