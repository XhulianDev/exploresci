        <h2>What is World Music?</h2>
        <p>
          World Music encompasses the diverse musical traditions of global cultures, from African drumming to Indian ragas and 
          Latin American salsa. It celebrates unique instruments, rhythms, and stories, like Youssou N’Dour’s Senegalese mbalax 
          or Ravi Shankar’s sitar in <em>Raga Jog</em>. This genre connects humanity through shared expression.

        <h2>Origins and Diversity</h2>
        <p>
          World Music draws from ancient traditions, shaped by rituals, folklore, and daily life. Aboriginal didgeridoo, Celtic 
          fiddles, and Andean panpipes reflect distinct histories. The 1980s “world music” label, popularized by artists like 
          Peter Gabriel, brought global sounds to Western audiences. Today, fusion genres blend traditions, as in Afrobeat’s mix
          of jazz and Nigerian rhythms.
        </p>
        <p>
          This diversity showcases music’s universal yet unique roots.

          Instruments like the kora, djembe, or tabla create distinctive textures. Vocal styles range from Mongolian overtone 
          singing to flamenco’s passionate cries. Call-and-response and communal performance often foster collective
          participation.
