        <h2>What is Rock and Roll?</h2>
        <p>
          Rock and Roll, born in the 1950s, is a high-energy genre blending blues, country, and rhythm and blues. Icons
          like Elvis Presley and The Beatles defined its raw, rebellious sound, with hits like Presley’s <em>Hound Dog</em> and 
          the Beatles’ <em>Hey Jude</em>. Known for electric guitars and driving rhythms, it captured youth culture’s spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its infectious vibe continues to shape music and attitudes worldwide.

        <h2>Origins and Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          Emerging in the U.S., Rock and Roll grew from African-American genres and post-war optimism. Chuck Berry’s
          guitar riffs and Little Richard’s wild performances set the stage. The 1960s British Invasion, led by
          The Rolling Stones, globalized the genre. From psychedelic rock to punk and grunge, with Nirvana’s
          <em>Nevermind</em>, it constantly reinvented itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          This evolution mirrors society’s changing energy and defiance.

          redefined albums. Jimi Hendrix’s guitar wizardry shone in <em>Purple Haze</em>. Bob Dylan blended rock with folk, 
          influencing protest music. Later, bands like Led Zeppelin and Queen elevated rock’s theatricality and innovation.

        <h2>Musical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          Rock and Roll thrives on amplified guitars, pounding drums, and charismatic vocals. Simple chord progressions,
          like the 12-bar blues, drive anthems. Lyrics often explore love, rebellion, or freedom, resonating with youth. 
          Subgenres like heavy metal or indie rock add distortion or introspection, creating diverse sonic landscapes.
        </p>
        <p>
          These traits make rock a bold, universal voice.

        <h2>Impact on Society</h2>
        <p>
          Rock and Roll challenged norms, fueling 1960s counterculture and anti-war movements. Woodstock and Live Aid united 
          millions through music. It broke racial and social barriers, blending diverse influences. Today, rock festivals, 
          fashion, and even video games carry its rebellious spirit, while schools teach its history, cementing its
          cultural footprint.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its influence proves music’s power to inspire and unite.
