        <h2>What are Social Movements?</h2>
        <p>
          Social movements are organized, collective efforts to promote or resist change in society, driven by shared goals and 
          a vision for a better future. From civil rights to environmental activism, they challenge norms, policies, or power 
          structures. Sociologists study these movements to understand how ordinary people spark extraordinary transformations 
          in social, political, and cultural landscapes.
        </p>
        <p>
          By examining their dynamics, we uncover the power of collective action to reshape societies and address injustices.

        <h2>Types of Social Movements</h2>
        <p>
          Social movements vary in scope and purpose. Reform movements, like women’s suffrage, seek incremental policy changes 
          within existing systems. Revolutionary movements, such as anti-colonial struggles, aim to overhaul societal
          structures. Expressive movements focus on cultural or personal change, like the self-help movement. For example, the 
          climate movement blends reform (policy advocacy) and expressive (lifestyle changes) goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          These distinctions highlight the diverse ways movements drive progress, adapting to specific social contexts.

        <h2>Theories of Social Movements</h2>
        <p>
          Sociological theories explain how movements emerge and succeed. Resource mobilization theory emphasizes the need for 
          resources, like funding or media access, to sustain activism. Political opportunity theory suggests movements thrive 
          when political systems are open to change, as during democratic reforms. Framing theory highlights how movements
          craft compelling narratives, like “equality for all,” to rally support.
        </p>
        <p>
          These frameworks reveal the strategic and social factors that turn grievances into impactful campaigns.

        <h2>Impact of Social Movements</h2>
        <p>
          Social movements have reshaped history: The civil rights movement ended legal segregation in the U.S., expanding 
          equality. Feminist movements secured voting rights and workplace protections. Recent movements, like #MeToo, shifted 
          cultural norms around accountability. Beyond policy, movements inspire new values, like sustainability, and empower 
          marginalized voices, fostering broader social inclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their legacy shows how collective action can challenge entrenched systems and ignite lasting change.

        <h2>Empowering Change Today</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding social movements fuels modern efforts to drive progress. Grassroots campaigns use social media to 
          amplify voices, connecting activists globally. Schools teach histories of movements, inspiring youth to engage 
          civically. Organizations draw on movement strategies to advocate for policies, from climate action to racial justice, 
          ensuring diverse communities shape their futures.
        </p>
        <p>
          By learning from movements, we empower individuals and societies to confront challenges with courage and solidarity.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Social movements and change are the engines of societal progress, turning collective visions into reality through 
          activism and resilience. By exploring their types, theories, and impacts, sociology illuminates how people challenge 
          injustice and redefine norms. This field inspires us to join or support movements, building a world where equity and 
          opportunity flourish.
