        <h2>Understanding Race and Ethnicity</h2>
        <p>
          Race and ethnicity are social constructs that categorize people based on physical traits or cultural heritage, 
          profoundly shaping identities and social interactions. Race often refers to perceived biological differences, like 
          skin color, while ethnicity encompasses shared cultural practices, such as language or traditions. Sociologists study 
          these categories to uncover how they influence inequality, belonging, and social cohesion.
        </p>
        <p>
          By examining race and ethnicity, we reveal the mechanisms behind discrimination and the pathways to fostering 
          inclusive societies.

        <h2>Social Construction of Race</h2>
        <p>
          Race is not a biological fact but a social construct, created and sustained through historical and cultural
          processes. For example, racial categories have shifted over time—once, Irish immigrants were not considered “white”
          in the U.S. These classifications often serve to justify power imbalances, as seen in colonialism or slavery, where 
          race was used to dehumanize groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recognizing race as constructed challenges assumptions and highlights the need to address its real-world impacts on 
          opportunity and treatment.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Prejudice and Discrimination</h2>
        <p>
          Prejudice involves negative attitudes toward groups based on race or ethnicity, while discrimination translates these 
          biases into actions, like denying jobs or housing. Stereotypes, such as assuming a group is inherently better at 
          certain skills, fuel these behaviors. Systemic racism embeds inequality in institutions, like policing or education, 
          perpetuating disparities even without overt prejudice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding these dynamics is crucial for dismantling barriers and promoting fairness across diverse communities.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Ethnicity and Cultural Identity</h2>
        <p>
          Ethnicity ties individuals to shared cultural roots, like traditions, religion, or ancestry, fostering a sense of 
          belonging. For instance, celebrating cultural festivals can strengthen ethnic identity. However, ethnic groups may 
          face marginalization, as seen in tensions over language or customs in multicultural societies. Ethnicity can also 
          intersect with race, complicating experiences of inclusion or exclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          These identities enrich societies but require mutual respect to prevent conflict and ensure equitable treatment.
        </p>

        <h2>Building Inclusive Societies</h2>
        <p>
          Sociological insights into race and ethnicity guide efforts to create equity. Schools promote diversity through 
          curricula that celebrate varied histories, fostering empathy. Workplaces implement anti-bias training to reduce 
          discrimination, leveling opportunities. Community initiatives, like intercultural dialogues, bridge divides, 
          encouraging collaboration. These steps, grounded in understanding social constructs, aim to dismantle systemic 
          barriers and honor diverse identities.
        </p>
        <p>
          By prioritizing inclusion, we cultivate societies where all voices are valued and empowered.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Race and ethnicity, as social constructs, shape identities, opportunities, and social dynamics through prejudice, 
          systemic inequality, and cultural heritage. Sociology’s exploration of these forces reveals pathways to challenge 
          discrimination and embrace diversity. This field inspires us to build communities that recognize the humanity in
          every identity, fostering justice and unity in an interconnected world.
