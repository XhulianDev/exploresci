        <h2>What is Social Stratification?</h2>
        <p>
          Social stratification refers to the hierarchical organization of society, where individuals and groups are ranked 
          based on factors like wealth, power, and status. This system creates layers—classes or strata—that shape access to 
          resources, opportunities, and influence. Sociologists study stratification to understand how these divisions form and 
          perpetuate inequality across generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          By examining these structures, we gain insight into the root causes of disparities and the mechanisms that maintain
          or challenge social hierarchies.

        <h2>Dimensions of Stratification</h2>
        <p>
          Stratification operates through multiple dimensions: Economic class divides people based on income and wealth, from 
          the affluent elite to the working poor. Status, or social prestige, elevates groups like professionals over manual 
          laborers. Power, the ability to influence, concentrates in political or corporate leaders. For example, a CEO wields 
          more power than a factory worker, reflecting overlapping inequalities.
        </p>
        <p>
          These dimensions interact, shaping life chances, from education access to health outcomes, across diverse societies.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Theories of Stratification</h2>
        <p>
          Sociological theories explain why stratification exists. Functionalists, like Kingsley Davis, argue that unequal 
          rewards motivate people to fill essential roles, like doctors requiring years of training. Conflict theorists, 
          inspired by Karl Marx, see stratification as a tool of exploitation, where the wealthy maintain dominance over the 
          working class. Max Weber’s multidimensional view combines class, status, and power to explain complex hierarchies.
        </p>
        <p>
          These perspectives reveal the tensions and justifications behind societal divisions, guiding efforts to address 
          inequality.

        <h2>Consequences of Inequality</h2>
        <p>
          Inequality has profound effects: Economic disparities limit access to quality education or healthcare, perpetuating 
          poverty cycles. Social exclusion isolates marginalized groups, fostering resentment or unrest. Power imbalances skew 
          policies toward the elite, as seen in tax systems favoring the wealthy. For instance, children from low-income 
          families often face barriers to upward mobility, reinforcing stratification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding these consequences highlights the urgency of addressing inequality to create fairer, more cohesive 
          societies.
        </p>

        <h2>Addressing Social Divides</h2>
        <p>
          Efforts to reduce inequality reshape how societies function. Progressive policies, like universal healthcare, aim to 
          level access to essential services. Education reforms expand opportunities, empowering disadvantaged groups. 
          Grassroots movements advocate for fair wages, challenging entrenched power structures. These initiatives, informed by 
          sociological insights, strive to dismantle barriers and foster equity across communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          By tackling stratification, we move toward societies where opportunity and dignity are shared more broadly.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Social stratification and inequality define the layers of society, shaping access to resources and opportunities 
          through class, status, and power. By exploring its dimensions, theories, and consequences, sociology uncovers the 
          roots of disparity and points to solutions. This field inspires us to challenge hierarchies and build communities
          that prioritize fairness and inclusion for all.
