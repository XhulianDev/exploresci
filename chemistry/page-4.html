        <p>
          Chemical reactions are at the heart of chemistry, transforming substances into new forms with different properties. 
          Understanding how reactions occur and how to quantify the substances involved is essential for mastering chemical 
          processes, both in theory and in practice.

        <h2>What is a Chemical Reaction?</h2>
        <p>
          A chemical reaction is a process where reactants are converted into products through the breaking and forming of 
          chemical bonds. Observable signs of a chemical reaction may include color changes, gas production,
          temperature changes, or the formation of a precipitate.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Types of Chemical Reactions</h2>
        <p>
          Chemical reactions can be classified into several major types based on the nature of the changes occurring:
        </p>

        <h3>Synthesis Reactions</h3>
        <p>
          In a synthesis reaction, two or more simple substances combine to form a more complex product. Example: 
          2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O.
        </p>

        <h3>Decomposition Reactions</h3>
        <p>
          A decomposition reaction occurs when a compound breaks down into simpler substances. Example: 
          2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂.
        </p>

        <h3>Single Replacement Reactions</h3>
        <p>
          In these reactions, an element replaces another element in a compound. Example: 
          Zn + CuSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Cu.
        </p>

        <h3>Double Replacement Reactions</h3>
        <p>
          Double replacement reactions involve the exchange of ions between two compounds, often producing a precipitate, gas, 
          or water. Example: 
          AgNO₃ + NaCl → AgCl + NaNO₃.
        </p>

        <h3>Combustion Reactions</h3>
        <p>
          Combustion reactions occur when a substance reacts rapidly with oxygen, releasing energy in the form of light or heat.
          Example: CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Balancing Chemical Equations</h2>
        <p>
          Balancing chemical equations ensures that the law of conservation of mass is obeyed: the number of atoms of each 
          element must be the same on both sides of the equation. This is crucial for accurate calculations and understanding 
          the reaction mechanism.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Mole Concept in Reactions</h2>
        <p>
          The mole is a fundamental unit in chemistry used to count particles at the atomic scale. 
          It allows chemists to relate the mass of substances to the number of atoms, ions, or molecules involved in a reaction.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Stoichiometric Calculations</h2>
        <p>
          Stoichiometry involves using balanced chemical equations to calculate the relationships between reactants and
          products. 
          These calculations determine how much reactant is needed or how much product will be formed under ideal conditions.
        </p>

        <h3>Mass-to-Mass Calculations</h3>
        <p>
          By using molar masses and mole ratios from the balanced equation, chemists can determine the mass of a reactant
          needed to produce a certain mass of product, or vice versa.
        </p>

        <h3>Limiting Reactant and Excess Reactant</h3>
        <p>
          In many reactions, one reactant is completely consumed first — the limiting reactant — determining the amount of 
          product formed. 
          The other reactants are in excess.
        </p>

        <h3>Percent Yield</h3>
        <p>
          Percent yield compares the actual amount of product obtained to the theoretical maximum, providing insight into the 
          efficiency of a reaction.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Applications of Stoichiometry</h2>
        <p>
          Stoichiometric principles are vital in industries such as pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, and environmental science, 
          where precise chemical reactions are essential for product quality and environmental safety.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Mastery of chemical reactions and stoichiometric calculations provides a powerful framework for understanding and 
          controlling chemical processes. From balancing equations to optimizing production in industry, these concepts form 
          a cornerstone of modern chemistry.
