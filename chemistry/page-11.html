          Analytical chemistry focuses on the methods and techniques used to determine the composition and structure 
          of substances. It is essential for scientific research, quality control, environmental monitoring, 
          and many other fields that require precise chemical information.

        <h2>Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Analytical chemistry is often divided into two main areas: qualitative and quantitative analysis. 
          Qualitative analysis identifies the components of a substance, while quantitative analysis measures 
          the exact amount of each component. Both approaches are crucial for a complete understanding 
          of chemical samples.

      <section>
        <h2>Qualitative Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Qualitative analysis involves detecting and identifying chemical elements or compounds present 
          in a sample. Techniques include precipitation reactions, flame tests, and color changes, which 
          can indicate the presence of specific ions or functional groups.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Quantitative Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Quantitative analysis determines how much of a particular substance is present in a sample. 
          Methods such as gravimetric analysis (measuring mass) and volumetric analysis (measuring volume) 
          are traditional approaches, while modern techniques often involve instrumentation for greater precision.

        <h2>Instrumental Techniques</h2>
        <p>
          Instrumental methods have revolutionized analytical chemistry by providing fast, accurate, and sensitive measurements.
          Key techniques include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Spectroscopy</strong> — studies the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation.
          Common types include UV-Vis, IR, and NMR spectroscopy.</li>
          <li><strong>Chromatography</strong> — separates components in a mixture based on their movement through a medium.
          Gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC) are widely used forms.</li>
          <li><strong>Electrochemical analysis</strong> — measures electrical properties such as voltage or current to
          determine chemical information.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Applications of Analytical Chemistry</h2>
        <p>
          Analytical chemistry has broad applications across various industries. In healthcare, it is used for blood analysis 
          and drug development. Environmental scientists monitor pollutants in air and water using analytical methods. 
          In manufacturing, it ensures the quality and consistency of products like pharmaceuticals, food, and materials.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Analytical chemistry provides the tools necessary for understanding and controlling the chemical world. 
          Through both traditional and modern techniques, scientists can identify substances, measure concentrations, 
          and ensure the safety, quality, and effectiveness of countless products and processes.
