        <p>
          Chemical equilibrium occurs when a reversible reaction proceeds in both forward and backward directions at equal
          rates, resulting in constant concentrations of reactants and products. At equilibrium, the system appears static, but 
          molecular processes continue dynamically. Understanding equilibrium is crucial for predicting the behavior of chemical
          systems and optimizing reactions in both laboratory and industrial settings.

        <h2>Reversible Reactions</h2>
        <p>
          In reversible reactions, products can react to form reactants, and vice versa. A classic example is the synthesis of 
          ammonia (NH₃) from nitrogen (N₂) and hydrogen (H₂) gases. At the beginning, the forward reaction dominates, but as 
          products accumulate, the reverse reaction accelerates until equilibrium is reached.

        <h2>The Equilibrium Constant (K)</h2>
        <p>
          The equilibrium constant (K) quantifies the ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations at equilibrium,
          each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. A large K value (&gt;1) favors product formation,
          while a small K (&lt;1) favors reactants. K remains constant at a given temperature and provides valuable information 
          about the position of equilibrium.

      <section>
        <h2>Le Chatelier’s Principle</h2>
        <p>
          Le Chatelier’s Principle states that if a change in concentration, pressure, or temperature is imposed on a system at 
          equilibrium, the system will adjust to partially counteract the disturbance. For instance, increasing the 
          concentration of reactants will shift the equilibrium toward producing more products. This principle helps predict and
          manipulate chemical behavior under varying conditions.

        <h2>Applications in Industry and Biology</h2>
        <p>
          In industry, controlling equilibrium conditions is critical for maximizing yields. For example, in the Haber process 
          for ammonia production, pressure and temperature are carefully adjusted to favor product formation. In biological systems, 
          equilibrium principles govern processes such as oxygen binding to hemoglobin, where shifts in partial pressures of oxygen 
          influence binding and release, ensuring efficient oxygen transport in the body.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Chemical equilibrium reveals the dynamic nature of reactions and the delicate balance between reactants and products. 
          Mastering equilibrium concepts, including the equilibrium constant and Le Chatelier’s Principle, is essential for 
          controlling chemical processes in both technological and biological systems.
