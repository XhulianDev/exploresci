          Atomic theory is a scientific theory that explains the nature and behavior of matter by describing it as being
          made up of atoms. Over time, this theory has evolved through the contributions of various scientists, leading to our 
          current understanding of atomic structure.

        <h2>The Development of Atomic Theory</h2>
        <p>
          The concept of the atom dates back to ancient Greece, with philosophers like Democritus suggesting that matter was 
          made up of indivisible particles called atoms. 
          However, it was John Dalton in the early 19th century who proposed the modern atomic theory, which states that atoms 
          are the basic units of matter, and that chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of these atoms.

        <h2>Key Discoveries in Atomic Theory</h2>
        <p>
          Several key discoveries have shaped atomic theory, such as J.J. Thomson's discovery of the electron,
          Ernest Rutherford's model of the atom, and Niels Bohr's development of the Bohr model. These discoveries led to
          a better understanding of atomic structure, with electrons surrounding a central nucleus made up of protons and
          neutrons.

        <h2>Modern Atomic Model</h2>
        <p>
          The modern atomic model is based on quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of electrons as existing in 
          probabilistic regions called orbitals. 
          Unlike the classical models, the quantum model accounts for the wave-particle duality of electrons, as well as
          their interaction with electromagnetic radiation.

        <h2>The Structure of the Atom</h2>
        <p>
          An atom consists of a nucleus, made up of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons, surrounded by
          negatively charged electrons. 
          The number of protons determines the element, while the arrangement of electrons influences the chemical behavior of 
          the atom.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Atomic theory has undergone significant changes over the centuries, but it remains a fundamental aspect of chemistry. 
          The development of atomic theory has provided insight into the nature of matter, the structure of atoms, and the ways 
          in which chemical reactions occur. It continues to shape the future of scientific exploration and technological 
          advancement.
