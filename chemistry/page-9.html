        <p>
          Electrochemistry focuses on chemical reactions that involve the transfer of electrons, known as redox reactions. 
          These processes underpin essential technologies such as batteries, fuel cells, and industrial electroplating. 
          Understanding how chemical energy converts to electrical energy, and vice versa, is fundamental to many scientific 
          and engineering fields.

        <h2>Redox Reactions: Oxidation and Reduction</h2>
        <p>
          Redox reactions consist of two simultaneous processes: oxidation, the loss of electrons, and reduction, the gain of 
          electrons. In every redox reaction, one species is oxidized and another is reduced, maintaining the overall charge 
          balance. These reactions are critical in processes ranging from metal corrosion to biological respiration.

        <h2>Galvanic Cells, Electrolysis, and Standard Potentials</h2>
        <p>
          A galvanic cell (or voltaic cell) uses spontaneous redox reactions to produce electrical energy. It consists of two 
          half-cells connected by a salt bridge, where electrons flow from the anode (oxidation site) to the cathode
          (reduction site).
        </p>
        <p>
          Electrolysis, on the other hand, involves using electrical energy to drive non-spontaneous chemical reactions. It is 
          commonly used for decomposing compounds, such as water splitting or metal extraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standard electrode potentials (E°) help predict the direction of redox reactions and the voltage produced or required 
          in a cell. These values are measured under standard conditions (25°C, 1 atm pressure, 1 M concentrations).
        </p>

        <h2>Applications: Batteries and Electroplating</h2>
        <p>
          Batteries are practical implementations of galvanic cells, converting stored chemical energy into usable electrical 
          energy. Different types, such as alkaline, lithium-ion, and lead-acid batteries, power everything from portable 
          devices to electric vehicles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Electroplating utilizes electrolysis to deposit a thin layer of metal onto a surface. This process improves
          appearance, resistance to corrosion, and wear durability of objects like jewelry, automotive parts, and electronic 
          components.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Electrochemistry reveals the intricate relationship between electricity and chemical change. By understanding redox 
          reactions, galvanic cells, electrolysis, and electrode potentials, scientists and engineers develop technologies that 
          shape modern life, from energy storage solutions to advanced manufacturing processes.
