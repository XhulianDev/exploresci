          Organic chemistry is the branch of chemistry focused on the study of carbon-containing compounds. 
          Carbon’s unique ability to form strong covalent bonds with other elements, including itself, 
          leads to an incredible variety of structures and functions. Organic compounds are foundational 
          to life, industry, and technology.

        <h2>Introduction to Hydrocarbons</h2>
        <p>
          Hydrocarbons are the simplest organic compounds, composed solely of carbon and hydrogen. 
          They serve as the backbone for more complex molecules and are categorized into three major types:
        </p>

        <h3>Alkanes</h3>
        <p>
          Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons with single bonds between carbon atoms. Their general formula 
          is C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>. Examples include methane (CH₄) and ethane (C₂H₆).
        </p>

        <h3>Alkenes</h3>
        <p>
          Alkenes contain at least one carbon-carbon double bond. Their general formula is C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>. 
          Ethene (C₂H₄) is the simplest alkene.
        </p>

        <h3>Alkynes</h3>
        <p>
          Alkynes feature at least one carbon-carbon triple bond. Their general formula is C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n-2</sub>. 
          Ethyne (C₂H₂), commonly known as acetylene, is an important alkyne used in welding.
        </p>

        <h2>Functional Groups</h2>
        <p>
          Functional groups are specific groupings of atoms within molecules that are responsible for the characteristic 
          chemical reactions of those molecules. Examples include hydroxyl groups (-OH) in alcohols, carbonyl groups 
          (C=O) in ketones and aldehydes, and carboxyl groups (-COOH) in carboxylic acids. Identifying functional groups 
          is essential for predicting chemical behavior.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Isomerism</h2>
        <p>
          Isomerism occurs when compounds have the same molecular formula but different structures or spatial arrangements. 
          Structural isomers differ in connectivity, while stereoisomers have the same connections but different spatial 
          orientations. 
          This phenomenon significantly impacts the physical and chemical properties of organic compounds.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Basic Organic Reactions</h2>
        <p>
          Organic compounds undergo various types of reactions, including addition, substitution, elimination, and
          oxidation-reduction reactions. 
          For example, alkenes readily participate in addition reactions, where atoms are added to the carbon-carbon double
          bond, resulting in a more saturated molecule.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Importance of Organic Chemistry</h2>
        <p>
          Organic chemistry is fundamental to many industries, from pharmaceuticals and petrochemicals to agriculture and 
          materials science. 
          Understanding carbon-based molecules allows scientists to develop new medicines, create advanced materials, and 
          explore the chemistry of life itself.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Organic chemistry reveals the incredible versatility of carbon and the vast array of compounds it forms. 
          Through the study of hydrocarbons, functional groups, isomerism, and organic reactions, we gain critical insights into
          the structure and behavior of molecules that impact every aspect of our lives.
