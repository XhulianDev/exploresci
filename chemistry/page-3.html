          Chemical bonds are the invisible forces that hold atoms together, creating the diverse substances in the universe. 
          These bonds, driven by electron interactions, allow atoms to achieve stability, often by fulfilling the octet rule, 
          where atoms seek a full outer electron shell. Understanding chemical bonds is key to explaining how matter behaves, 
          changes, and interacts.

        <h2>Types of Chemical Bonds</h2>
        <p>
          There are three primary types of chemical bonds: ionic, covalent, and metallic. Each arises from distinct electron 
          behaviors, leading to unique physical and chemical properties.
        </p>

        <h3>Ionic Bonds</h3>
        <p>
          Ionic bonds form between metals and nonmetals when one atom transfers electrons to another, creating oppositely 
          charged ions: a cation (positive) and an anion (negative). The electrostatic attraction between these ions holds them 
          together, as seen in compounds like sodium chloride (NaCl). Ionic compounds typically form crystalline solids, have 
          high melting points, and conduct electricity when dissolved in water.
        </p>

        <h3>Covalent Bonds</h3>
        <p>
          Covalent bonds occur when two nonmetals share one or more pairs of electrons, forming molecules. Bonds can be single, 
          double, or triple, depending on the number of shared electron pairs. For example, in water (H₂O), each hydrogen atom 
          shares an electron with oxygen. Covalent bonds can be polar (unequal electron sharing) or nonpolar (equal sharing), 
          affecting molecular behavior in reactions and solutions. Covalent compounds often have lower melting points and
          may not conduct electricity.
        </p>

        <h3>Metallic Bonds</h3>
        <p>
          Metallic bonds are unique to metals, where atoms share valence electrons in a "sea of electrons" that flows throughout
          the structure. This electron mobility explains metals’ conductivity, malleability, ductility, and luster. Metals like 
          copper or iron owe their properties to this bonding type.

        <h2>Bond Strength and Material Properties</h2>
        <p>
          The type and strength of chemical bonds dictate a substance’s physical properties. For example, diamond and graphite, 
          both made of carbon, differ vastly due to their bonding. Diamond’s strong, 3D covalent lattice makes it hard, while 
          graphite’s layered structure, with weaker interlayer forces, makes it soft and slippery.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Electronegativity and Bond Type</h2>
        <p>
          Electronegativity measures an atom’s ability to attract electrons in a bond. Large electronegativity differences 
          between atoms favor ionic bonds, while small differences lead to covalent bonds. This property helps predict bonding 
          behavior and molecular characteristics.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Chemical Bonds in Reactions</h2>
        <p>
          Chemical reactions involve breaking and forming bonds, with bond energy determining whether a reaction is exothermic 
          (energy-releasing) or endothermic (energy-absorbing). These processes are central to understanding chemical 
          transformations.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Modern Bonding Theories</h2>
        <p>
          Advanced theories like valence bond theory and molecular orbital theory provide deeper insights into bonding at the 
          quantum level. These models explain bond angles, molecular shapes, and electron behavior in complex molecules, 
          enhancing our understanding of chemical phenomena.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Chemical bonds are the foundation of molecular structure, governing interactions from simple compounds like water to 
          complex molecules like DNA. By determining material strength, reaction pathways, and molecular behavior, bonds unlock 
          chemistry’s deepest insights and most impactful applications.
