        <p>
          Environmental chemistry studies the chemical processes that occur in the environment and the effects of
          human activities on these processes. It focuses on understanding the sources, reactions, transport, and fate of 
          chemical species in air, water, and soil.

        <h2>Pollutants and Their Effects</h2>
        <p>
          Pollutants are substances introduced into the environment that cause harm or discomfort to living organisms or 
          ecosystems. 
          They include industrial waste, heavy metals, pesticides, and greenhouse gases. These pollutants can lead to
          problems such as water contamination, air pollution, soil degradation, and climate change.

        <h2>Natural Cycles of Elements</h2>
        <p>
          Elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur move through natural cycles that are essential for life. 
          The carbon cycle, for example, involves the exchange of carbon among the atmosphere, oceans, soil, and
          living organisms. 
          Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, can disrupt these cycles, leading to environmental challenges
          like global warming.
        </p>

        <h2>Impact of Chemistry on the Environment</h2>
        <p>
          Chemistry plays a vital role in both causing and solving environmental problems. Understanding chemical reactions 
          allows scientists to monitor pollution levels, develop methods for cleaning up contaminants (such as bioremediation), 
          and create more sustainable industrial processes. Green chemistry focuses on designing products and processes 
          that minimize the use and generation of hazardous substances.

      <section>
        <h2>Applications and Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          Environmental chemistry is critical in addressing modern environmental issues. For example, catalytic converters 
          reduce harmful emissions from vehicles, and wastewater treatment plants use chemical processes to purify water. 
          Advances in this field are essential for protecting ecosystems, human health, and the planet's future.

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          By understanding the chemical nature of environmental processes and pollutants, scientists and engineers can develop 
          innovative solutions to protect and restore our natural world. Environmental chemistry is a key discipline 
          for building a sustainable future.
