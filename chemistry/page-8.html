          Acid-base chemistry explores substances that can donate or accept protons or electrons, shaping countless reactions 
          in both nature and industry. Understanding acids, bases, and their interactions is fundamental for studying chemical 
          behavior, biological systems, and practical applications such as medicine and environmental science.

        <h2>Theories of Acids and Bases</h2>

        <h3>Arrhenius Theory</h3>
        <p>
          According to Arrhenius, an acid increases hydrogen ion (H⁺) concentration in aqueous solution, while a base increases 
          hydroxide ion (OH⁻) concentration. This definition, though limited to water-based systems, was the first systematic 
          approach to classifying acids and bases.
        </p>

        <h3>Brønsted-Lowry Theory</h3>
        <p>
          The Brønsted-Lowry model expands the concept: acids are proton donors, and bases are proton acceptors. This theory 
          applies beyond aqueous solutions and explains acid-base behavior in gases and non-water solvents.
        </p>

        <h3>Lewis Theory</h3>
        <p>
          Lewis further generalized the concept by defining acids as electron pair acceptors and bases as electron pair donors. 
          This approach emphasizes electron interactions, making it applicable to a wider range of chemical reactions, including
          those without hydrogen ions.

        <h2>pH, pOH, and Acid-Base Reactions</h2>
        <p>
          pH measures the concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺) in a solution, while pOH measures hydroxide ions (OH⁻)
          The two are related through the equation: pH + pOH = 14 at 25°C. Acid-base reactions typically involve the transfer of
          protons, and balancing these reactions ensures conservation of mass and charge, which is crucial in stoichiometric 
          calculations.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Titration and Indicators</h2>
        <p>
          Titration is a laboratory technique used to determine the concentration of an unknown acid or base by reacting it with
          a solution of known concentration. Indicators, such as phenolphthalein or litmus, change color at specific pH values, 
          signaling the endpoint of the titration. Accurate titration is essential in fields like pharmaceuticals, environmental
          analysis, and food chemistry.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Acid-base theories and measurements like pH and pOH are vital tools for understanding chemical processes. Techniques 
          such as titration and the use of indicators allow scientists to quantify and control reactions, highlighting the 
          importance of acid-base chemistry in both theoretical and practical applications.
