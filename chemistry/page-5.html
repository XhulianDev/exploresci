        <p>
          Thermochemistry is the branch of chemistry that studies the heat energy absorbed or released during chemical
          reactions. 
          This energy change provides deep insight into how and why reactions occur, as well as their potential applications in 
          everyday life and industry.

        <h2>What is Thermochemistry?</h2>
        <p>
          Thermochemistry examines the transfer of heat between a system and its surroundings during a chemical or
          physical change. 
          It helps chemists understand not just what products are formed, but also how energy is involved in the process.

        <h2>Enthalpy (ΔH)</h2>
        <p>
          Enthalpy is a measure of the total heat content of a system at constant pressure. It is denoted by the symbol H, and 
          the change in enthalpy during a reaction is represented as ΔH.
          This change tells us whether the system has absorbed or released heat:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>ΔH &lt; 0</strong> → The reaction is <strong>exothermic</strong> (heat is released)</li>
          <li><strong>ΔH &gt; 0</strong> → The reaction is <strong>endothermic</strong> (heat is absorbed)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions</h2>

        <h3>Exothermic Reactions</h3>
        <p>
          In an exothermic reaction, the system releases heat to its surroundings. 
          These reactions feel warm or hot and include combustion, neutralization, and many oxidation processes.
          Example: CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O  ΔH = -890 kJ/mol
        </p>

        <h3>Endothermic Reactions</h3>
        <p>
          Endothermic reactions absorb heat from the surroundings, making the environment feel cooler. 
          They include photosynthesis, decomposition of calcium carbonate, and melting ice.
          Example: CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂  ΔH = +178 kJ/mol
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The First Law of Thermodynamics</h2>
        <p>
          The first law of thermodynamics, also known as the law of conservation of energy, states that energy cannot be
          created or destroyed — it can only be transformed from one form to another.
        </p>

        <p>
          In thermochemistry, this means that the total energy change in a system must equal the heat added to the system minus 
          the work done by the system:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>ΔU = q - w</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>ΔU</strong> = change in internal energy</li>
          <li><strong>q</strong> = heat exchanged</li>
          <li><strong>w</strong> = work done by the system</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This principle helps chemists calculate how much energy is stored or released during chemical transformations and 
          ensures energy accounting is always accurate.
        </p>

        <h2>Applications of Thermochemistry</h2>
        <p>
          Thermochemistry plays a vital role in fields like engineering, environmental science, material science, and
          even medicine. 
          It helps optimize fuel usage, design efficient engines, monitor environmental changes, and develop new energy sources.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Thermochemistry bridges the gap between chemical reactions and energy. 
          By understanding enthalpy changes and applying the laws of thermodynamics, we gain powerful tools to predict and 
          control energy flow in chemical systems, from industrial reactors to biological cells.
