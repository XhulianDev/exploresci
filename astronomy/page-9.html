        <h2>Earth's Unique Place</h2>
        <p>
          Earth, a rocky planet in the Sun’s habitable zone, is the only known celestial body supporting life, with
          liquid water sustained by its distance from the star. Its 4.5-billion-year history, shaped by geological and 
          biological events, makes it a dynamic subject of study in May 2025.

        <h2>Geological History</h2>
        <p>
          Earth’s timeline spans the Hadean era of intense volcanism and ocean formation, followed by the Archean and 
          Proterozoic eras where life emerged around 3.5 billion years ago, evolving into multicellular organisms by
          1 billion years ago. The Phanerozoic era, starting 541 million years ago, saw the rise of diverse life forms,
          from fish to mammals, influenced by climate shifts, tectonics, and asteroid impacts.

        <h2>Ecosystems and Threats</h2>
        <p>
          Earth hosts diverse ecosystems, from Amazon rainforests to Arctic tundra, each supporting unique species, all 
          interconnected and vital for global biodiversity. These ecosystems face threats like climate change, driven by human 
          activities such as deforestation and pollution, alongside overfishing, which disrupts marine food chains, as 
          highlighted by 2025 environmental reports.

        <h2>Geological Processes and Climate</h2>
        <p>
          Tectonic movements, volcanic activity, and erosion shape Earth’s varied landscapes, creating habitats like mountains 
          and deserts, while oceans regulate climate by absorbing heat and carbon dioxide, supporting marine life from whales
          to corals. Human-induced climate change, accelerating since the industrial era, impacts weather patterns, sea levels, 
          and ecosystems, necessitating urgent study and action in 2025.

        <h2>Protective Features and Study</h2>
        <p>
          Earth’s magnetic field, generated by its molten iron core, shields the planet from solar wind, protecting 
          infrastructure like satellites and power grids from charged particles. Geology, using tools like seismology and 
          geochemistry, alongside ongoing climate research, deepens our understanding of Earth’s systems, ensuring its 
          preservation for future generations as we explore its role in the cosmos.
