        <h2>Composition of Stars</h2>
        <p>
          Stars, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, form from Big Bang elements. Through nuclear fusion, they create 
          heavier elements, dispersing them into space upon death, shaping the universe’s chemical evolution as of May 2025.

        <h2>Stellar Life Cycle</h2>
        <p>
          Stars form in nebulae, evolving from protostars to main sequence via fusion. Their lifespan depends on mass—massive 
          stars last millions of years, while sun-like stars endure for 10 billion, transitioning into red giants.

        <h2>End Stages of Stars</h2>
        <p>
          Low-mass stars become white dwarfs, cooling over billions of years. Massive stars explode as supernovae, forming 
          neutron stars or black holes, with 2025 studies confirming their role in heavy element creation.

        <h2>Galactic Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          Galaxies form hierarchically, merging smaller structures into massive systems. The cosmic web—clusters, filaments, and
          voids—reveals matter distribution, while supermassive black holes at galactic centers drive evolution, per 2025 data.

        <h2>Search for Life</h2>
        <p>
          Studying habitable zones in galaxies assesses life’s potential. Conditions for liquid water and elements like carbon 
          guide the search—2025 research targets these zones to estimate extraterrestrial life likelihood.
