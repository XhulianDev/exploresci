        <h2>Overview of Planets</h2>
        <p>
          Planets, celestial bodies orbiting stars without generating their own light, are divided into terrestrial (rocky) and 
          gas giants (hydrogen-helium dominated). Our solar system includes eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
          Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, each formed from a disk of gas and dust around a young star. This process,
          where dust particles coalesce into planetesimals and eventually planets, varies based on stellar conditions, offering 
          insights into cosmic evolution as of May 2025.

        <h2>Terrestrial Planets</h2>
        <p>
          Mercury, the smallest and closest to the Sun, features a cratered surface with no atmosphere, enduring extreme 
          temperature swings. Venus, second from the Sun, is shrouded in a toxic atmosphere causing a severe greenhouse effect, 
          making it hotter than Mercury despite its distance. Earth, uniquely life-supporting, boasts a dynamic atmosphere and 
          active geology, sustaining diverse ecosystems. Mars, the most Earth-like, has a thin atmosphere, evidence of past 
          water, and polar ice caps, fueling speculation about ancient microbial life.

        <h2>Gas Giants</h2>
        <p>
          Jupiter, the largest at over 11 times Earth’s size, hosts a massive storm (Great Red Spot) persisting for 400 years 
          and 79 moons, including volcanic Io and ocean-bearing Europa. Saturn, renowned for its icy rings, has a
          nitrogen-methane-rich moon, Titan, with liquid methane lakes. Uranus, tilted on its side, exhibits a methane-induced 
          blue hue, with seasons lasting 20 years and 27 moons like Miranda. Neptune, the windiest with speeds up to
          2,400 km/h, shows a deep blue color, a Great Dark Spot, and 14 moons, including frigid Triton at -235°C.

        <h2>Dwarf Planets and Exploration</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond the main planets, dwarf planets like Pluto in the Kuiper Belt, along with Ceres, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris, 
          are small, icy bodies offering clues to solar system origins. Exploration missions, such as Voyager’s outer planet 
          flybys and Mars rovers like Perseverance, have deepened our understanding, while exoplanet discoveries—thousands by 
          2025—broaden the search for life, revealing diverse planetary systems.

        <h2>Significance of Planetary Study</h2>
        <p>
          Studying planets illuminates Earth’s formation, evolution, and potential for life elsewhere. Advances in 2025, 
          including upcoming missions and improved detection methods, continue to unravel planetary mysteries, enhancing our 
          grasp of the universe’s complexity and our place within it, with hopes of finding habitable worlds beyond our cosmic 
          neighborhood.
