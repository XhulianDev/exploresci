        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          The Moon, Earth’s only natural satellite, spans a diameter one-quarter of Earth’s and has a mass one-eightieth, 
          orbiting at an average distance of 238,900 miles with a 27.3-day cycle. Its rocky, airless surface, covered in 
          regolith from meteoroid impacts, consists mainly of oxygen, silicon, and aluminum, alongside iron, calcium, and 
          magnesium, resembling Earth’s crust composition, as analyzed in May 2025.

        <h2>Formation and Features</h2>
        <p>
          Formed 4.5 billion years ago, likely via the giant impact hypothesis—a Mars-sized body colliding with Earth—the Moon 
          features craters like the South Pole-Aitken Basin (1,550 miles wide), mountains such as the Apennines, and rilles
          from ancient lava flows. Tidally locked, its far side, unseen from Earth, was first imaged by Luna 3 in 1959, 
          revealing a stark contrast to the familiar near side.

        <h2>Scientific Exploration</h2>
        <p>
          Since Apollo 11’s 1969 landing, 12 astronauts have explored the Moon, complemented by robotic missions like the Lunar 
          Reconnaissance Orbiter and China’s Chang’e series, providing data on lunar geology. NASA’s Artemis program, aiming
          for a 2024 return, seeks a sustainable presence, while 2025 studies use lunar samples to understand early
          solar system dynamics and Earth’s history.

        <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>
          The Moon influences Earth’s tides via gravity and has inspired global cultures, from Greek goddess Selene to
          Hindu god Chandra, symbolizing femininity and beauty. Associated with myths of lunacy, it permeates art and 
          literature—Shakespeare’s sonnets, Pink Floyd’s music—while Native American and Wiccan traditions revere its cycles as 
          spiritual symbols of renewal and strength.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Modern Relevance</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond science, the Moon drives space tourism and resource exploration, with companies eyeing helium-3 mining for 
          fusion energy by 2025. Its role in culture and science—from tidal effects to a testing ground for Mars 
          missions—ensures its enduring allure, blending natural wonder with human ambition for cosmic exploration and 
          understanding.
