        <h2>What Is the Whirlpool Galaxy?</h2>
        <p>
          The Whirlpool Galaxy (M51, NGC 5194), a spiral galaxy 23 million light-years away in Canes Venatici, spans 100,000 
          light-years. Part of the M51 Group, it interacts with NGC 5195, as observed in May 2025.

        <h2>Structure and Features</h2>
        <p>
          Featuring prominent spiral arms with star-forming regions and a central bulge housing a supermassive black hole, its 
          disk hosts bright stars and gas, with a halo extending its influence, per 2025 imaging.

        <h2>Interaction with NGC 5195</h2>
        <p>
          Gravitational interactions with NGC 5195 distort M51â€™s arms, triggering star formation in blue regions. This ongoing 
          merger, studied in 2025, shapes tidal features and enhances stellar birth rates.

        <h2>Evolutionary Impact</h2>
        <p>
          The eventual merger with NGC 5195 will form a larger galaxy, sparking star bursts and merging central black holes. 
          This process, modeled in 2025, highlights galaxy evolution dynamics over millions of years.

        <h2>Scientific Significance</h2>
        <p>
          Studies of M51 elucidate spiral arm formation and dark matter roles. Its visibility aids astrophotography, with 2025 
          advancements in spectroscopy and simulations deepening insights into galactic interactions.
