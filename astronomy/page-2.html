        <h2>What Is the Universe?</h2>
        <p>
          The Universe encompasses all matter, energy, and space, spanning 93 billion light-years in diameter. It includes 
          galaxies, stars, planets, and more, with ongoing expansion as confirmed by cosmological studies in May 2025.

        <h2>Key Components</h2>
        <p>
          Galaxies, hosting billions of stars, vary in shape—spiral, elliptical, or irregular. Stars like the Sun, planets, 
          asteroids, and comets form the cosmic tapestry, interacting through gravity and energy forms like light and radiation.

        <h2>Structure and Composition</h2>
        <p>
          The Universe expands, driven by dark energy (68%) and dark matter (27%), inferred from gravitational effects. Visible 
          matter, including stars and galaxies, shapes its structure, as mapped by 2025 telescope observations.

        <h2>Historical Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          Originating 13.8 billion years ago in the Big Bang, the Universe evolved from a singularity, forming atoms, stars, and
          galaxies. The Solar System emerged 4.6 billion years ago, with Earth hosting life shaped by cosmic events.

        <h2>Scientific Advancements</h2>
        <p>
          From ancient observations to Einstein’s relativity and the 1960s cosmic microwave background discovery, advancements 
          like the Hubble Telescope and Large Hadron Collider deepen our understanding, with 2025 research probing dark energy 
          mysteries.
