        <h2>Origins and Theory</h2>
        <p>
          Black holes, conceptualized by John Michell in 1783, gained traction with Einstein’s 1915 theory of general
          relativity, which describes gravity’s effect on spacetime curvature. They form singularities—points of infinite 
          density—surrounded by an event horizon, beyond which nothing escapes, a phenomenon driven by extreme gravitational 
          collapse, widely studied by May 2025.

        <h2>Types and Formation</h2>
        <p>
          Black holes vary by mass: stellar black holes arise from massive star collapses, ranging a few solar masses, while 
          supermassive black holes, millions to billions of solar masses, anchor galaxy centers, likely formed through mergers. 
          Their immense density warps spacetime, creating gravitational time dilation, where time slows near them, a key 
          relativity prediction confirmed in 2025 observations.

        <h2>Cosmic Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Black holes shape galaxies by influencing star orbits and fueling star formation via energy outbursts from infalling 
          matter, such as radiation and particle jets. Supermassive black holes at galactic cores drive galactic bulges, while 
          mergers produce gravitational waves—first detected by LIGO in 2015—offering insights into their dynamics and cosmic 
          evolution as of 2025.

        <h2>Advanced Properties</h2>
        <p>
          Black holes exhibit unique traits like Hawking radiation, suggesting they emit particles and may evaporate over eons, 
          tied to their event horizon’s entropy in black hole thermodynamics. This field, explored in 2025, links
          thermodynamics to black hole physics, while the unresolved information paradox questions whether data swallowed by 
          black holes is lost or preserved in quantum forms.

        <h2>Observation and Mysteries</h2>
        <p>
          Invisible due to their light-trapping nature, black holes are detected via gravitational effects or waves, with 2025 
          tech like advanced telescopes enhancing studies of their masses and spins. Mysteries persist, including the 
          singularity’s nature and matter’s fate inside, driving ongoing research into Planckian matter and
          the fundamental laws governing these cosmic enigmas.
