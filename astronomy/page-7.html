        <h2>What Is the Sun?</h2>
        <p>
          The Sun, a G-type main-sequence star (yellow dwarf), sits at the solar system's center, spanning
          1.39 million kilometers with a mass of 1.989 x 10^30 kg. It powers life on Earth with 3.8 x 10^26 watts via nuclear 
          fusion, as observed in May 2025.

        <h2>Internal Structure</h2>
        <p>
          The Sun features a core at 15 million°C fusing hydrogen into helium, a radiative zone transferring energy via photons 
          up to 70% of its radius, a convective zone with plasma currents, and a corona reaching 2 million°C, powered by 
          magnetic fields, per 2025 studies.

        <h2>Solar Activity and Effects</h2>
        <p>
          The 11-year solar cycle drives sunspot activity, flares, and coronal mass ejections, impacting Earth’s magnetic field,
          satellite operations, and space health. The solar wind, a stream of protons and electrons, shapes space weather, noted
          in 2025 data.

        <h2>Magnetic Field Research</h2>
        <p>
          Helioseismology tracks solar oscillations to map the magnetic field, influencing sunspots and flares. This field’s 
          complexity, studied with 2025 advancements, remains a key focus for understanding solar dynamics and energy output.

        <h2>Solar Neutrinos and Earth Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Solar neutrinos, emitted from the core’s fusion, probe the Sun’s interior, revealing its evolution. The Sun’s 
          radiation and wind influence Earth’s climate, ozone layer, and space tech, with 2025 research enhancing predictions of
          these effects.
