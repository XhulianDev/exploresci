        <h2>What Is the Big Bang Theory?</h2>
        <p>
          The Big Bang theory posits the universe began 13.8 billion years ago from a singularity, expanding rapidly via 
          inflation into the cosmos we know today, supported by evidence as of May 2025.

        <h2>Historical Development</h2>
        <p>
          Proposed by Georges Lemaître in the 1920s as the "primeval atom," the theory gained traction in the 1960s with the 
          discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation by Penzias and Wilson, affirming its validity.

        <h2>Key Evidence</h2>
        <p>
          Cosmic microwave background radiation, uniform at 2.7 Kelvin, and the abundance of hydrogen and helium align with 
          Big Bang predictions. Galaxy distribution further supports the theory’s early uniformity, as noted in 2025 studies.

        <h2>Cosmological Insights</h2>
        <p>
          The theory reveals dark matter (27% of mass) and dark energy (68%), driving accelerated expansion. It also traces the 
          early universe’s atom formation, shaping our understanding of its evolution by May 2025.

        <h2>Challenges and Future</h2>
        <p>
          Unresolved issues include matter-antimatter asymmetry and dark matter detection. Future research may clarify the 
          universe’s fate—expansion, Big Crunch, or Big Rip—as explored in 2025 cosmological models.
