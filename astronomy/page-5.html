        <h2>What Is the Andromeda Galaxy?</h2>
        <p>
          The Andromeda Galaxy (M31), a spiral galaxy 2.5 million light-years away, is the closest major galaxy to the Milky 
          Way. Part of the Local Group, it spans 220,000 light-years and hosts 1 trillion stars.

        <h2>Discovery and History</h2>
        <p>
          Noted by al-Sufi in 964 AD as "the little cloud," the Andromeda Galaxy was cataloged as M31 by Charles Messier in 
          1764, recognizing it as a distinct galaxy separate from the Milky Way.

        <h2>Structure and Composition</h2>
        <p>
          Featuring a central bulge, spiral arms rich in star-forming gas, and a dark matter halo extending 1 million 
          light-years, Andromeda’s disk stars rotate at 225 km/s, outpacing the Milky Way’s dynamics.

        <h2>Interactions and Future</h2>
        <p>
          Andromeda will collide with the Milky Way in 4.5 billion years, forming Milkomeda. Past interactions include 
          cannibalizing smaller galaxies, with satellite galaxies like M32 orbiting it, as modeled in 2025 simulations.

        <h2>Observation Techniques</h2>
        <p>
          Spectroscopy reveals Andromeda’s composition, while imaging and gravitational lensing map its structure and dark 
          matter. Recent 2025 computer simulations enhance understanding of its evolution and spiral arm dynamics.
