        <h2>What Is the Milky Way?</h2>
        <p>
          The Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy, spans 100,000 light-years and hosts 100–400 billion stars, including our solar 
          system. Formed 13.6 billion years ago, it features a central bulge, disk, and halo, as studied in May 2025.

        <h2>Structure of the Galaxy</h2>
        <p>
          Divided into a central bulge, disk, halo, and stellar halo, the Milky Way’s disk holds young stars in spiral arms, 
          while the halo contains older stars. Dark matter, 85% of its mass, ensures stability.

        <h2>Historical Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          A merger 10 billion years ago spurred star formation, while the central bulge formed 12 billion years ago. These 
          events, studied in 2025, highlight the galaxy’s dynamic past through gas and dust redistribution.

        <h2>Future Prospects</h2>
        <p>
          In 4 billion years, the Milky Way will collide with Andromeda, forming a new galaxy. Gas depletion may halt star 
          formation, leaving older stars dominant, as projected by 2025 models.

        <h2>Scientific Importance</h2>
        <p>
          Studying the Milky Way informs galaxy formation, star life cycles, and cosmic phenomena. Upcoming telescopes like the 
          James Webb in 2025 will deepen insights into dark matter, exoplanets, and black holes.
