        <h2>What Was World War II?</h2>
        <p>
          World War II, spanning from September 1, 1939, to September 2, 1945, was a cataclysmic global conflict that engulfed 
          over 30 nations and involved more than 100 million personnel. The war pitted the Allies—led by the United States, the 
          Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom—against the Axis powers, primarily Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, and Fascist 
          Italy. Marked by unprecedented total war, nations mobilized their full economic, industrial, and scientific might, 
          blurring the lines between civilian and military roles. Innovations like strategic bombing, aircraft warfare, and the 
          war’s only use of nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki made it the deadliest conflict in history, with 70 to 85 
          million fatalities, mostly civilians, due to combat, genocides like the Holocaust, starvation, and disease.

          Its scale and devastation reshaped the global order, leaving a profound legacy on politics, society, and technology.

        <h2>Origins and Rising Tensions</h2>
        <p>
          The seeds of World War II were sown in the unresolved tensions of World War I, compounded by the harsh Treaty of 
          Versailles, which crippled Germany economically and fueled resentment. The 1930s saw the rise of authoritarian
          regimes: 
          Adolf Hitler’s Nazi Germany pursued aggressive expansion, while Mussolini’s Italy invaded Ethiopia (1935), and Japan 
          waged war in China (1937). The Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) and Soviet-Japanese border clashes further destabilized 
          the global order. The war ignited when Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, prompting France and the United 
          Kingdom to declare war two days later. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact had already divided Eastern Europe between Germany 
          and the Soviet Union, setting the stage for rapid Axis conquests across the continent.
        </p>
        <p>
          These early aggressions exposed the failure of appeasement policies and the League of Nations to prevent conflict.

        <h2>Major Campaigns and Turning Points</h2>
        <p>
          From 1939 to 1941, the Axis powers dominated: Germany conquered much of Europe, including France by 1940, while Japan 
          expanded in Asia. The war’s scope widened with Germany’s 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the brutal
          Eastern Front, and Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, bringing the U.S. into the war. Key turning points came in
          1942–1943: the Allies halted Japan at the Battle of Midway, defeated Germany at Stalingrad, and expelled Axis
          forces from North Africa. 
          In 1944, the D-Day invasion of Normandy and Soviet advances in the east turned the tide. The war ended in Europe with 
          Hitler’s suicide and Germany’s surrender on May 8, 1945, and in the Pacific after atomic bombs devastated Hiroshima
          and Nagasaki, leading to Japan’s surrender on September 2, 1945.
        </p>
        <p>
          These campaigns showcased the war’s global reach and the staggering cost of resistance and aggression.

        <h2>Human Cost and Atrocities</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond battlefield losses, World War II unleashed unprecedented atrocities. The Holocaust, orchestrated by
          Nazi Germany, systematically murdered 6 million Jews alongside millions of Romani people, disabled individuals, and
          political dissidents. Japan’s occupation of Asia led to massacres like the Nanjing Massacre, while forced labor and 
          starvation killed millions more. Allied bombing campaigns, such as the firebombing of Dresden and Tokyo,
          devastated civilian populations. The war’s end brought accountability through the Nuremberg and Tokyo Trials,
          which prosecuted war crimes and set legal precedents for international justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          These horrors underscored the war’s moral and humanitarian toll, leaving scars that endure to this day.

        <h2>Legacy and Global Transformation</h2>
        <p>
          World War II fundamentally altered the world. The United Nations was established to prevent future conflicts, with
          the U.S., Soviet Union, China, France, and the UK as permanent Security Council members. The U.S. and Soviet Union 
          emerged as superpowers, igniting the Cold War’s ideological divide. Europe’s devastation accelerated decolonization in
          Africa and Asia, while economic recovery spurred global integration, notably through the European Union’s origins.
          The war also advanced technology—radar, jet engines, and nuclear power—while reshaping social norms, as women’s
          wartime roles paved the way for greater gender equity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its legacy remains a cornerstone for understanding modern geopolitics and human rights.
