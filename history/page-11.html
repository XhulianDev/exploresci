        <h2>Who Was Skanderbeg?</h2>
        <p>
          Gjergj Kastrioti, known as Skanderbeg (1405–1468), was an Albanian feudal lord and military commander who led a 
          remarkable 25-year resistance against the Ottoman Empire. Born into the noble Kastrioti family, he was sent as a 
          hostage to the Ottoman court, where he was educated and served for two decades, rising to the rank of sanjakbey of 
          Dibra by 1440. In 1443, he deserted the Ottomans during the Battle of Niš, reclaiming Krujë and uniting Albanian 
          principalities under the League of Lezhë in 1444. Signing himself *Dominus Albaniae* (“Lord of Albania”), he became a 
          symbol of Christian resistance in Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
          His leadership and victories shaped Albanian identity and European perceptions of Ottoman power.

        <h2>Early Life and Ottoman Service</h2>
        <p>
          Born in 1405 in what is now northern Albania, Gjergj Kastrioti was the son of Gjon Kastrioti, a local lord. Taken 
          hostage by the Ottomans around age 10, he was trained in the military and Islamic culture, earning the name İskender 
          Bey (Alexander Bey), later Albanianized to Skanderbeg. Serving the Ottoman sultan, he excelled as a commander, 
          participating in campaigns across the Balkans. His appointment as sanjakbey of Dibra in 1440 marked the peak of his 
          Ottoman career, but his allegiance shifted as he sought to liberate his homeland.
        </p>
        <p>
          This period of service honed his military skills, later turned against his former masters.

        <h2>Resistance and the League of Lezhë</h2>
        <p>
          In 1443, during the Ottoman campaign against Hungary, Skanderbeg deserted, raising the Albanian flag at Krujë and 
          rallying local nobles. In 1444, he convened the League of Lezhë, uniting Albanian fiefdoms under his leadership with 
          support from the Catholic Church and Venice. Over the next 25 years, his 10,000-strong army repeatedly defeated
          larger Ottoman forces, defending a small but strategic territory in northern Albania. Key victories included
          the sieges of Krujë (1450, 1466–1467), earning him admiration across Europe as a Christian bulwark against Islam.
        </p>
        <p>
          His strategic brilliance frustrated Ottoman expansion and inspired a united Albanian front.

        <h2>International Alliances and Later Campaigns</h2>
        <p>
          Skanderbeg forged alliances to sustain his resistance. The 1451 Treaty of Gaeta with the Kingdom of Naples provided 
          de jure recognition of Neapolitan sovereignty over Albania, securing military and financial aid while preserving his 
          de facto independence. He supported Ferdinand I of Naples against John of Anjou (1460–1461) and joined Venice in the 
          Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–1479). In 1463, Pope Pius II planned a crusade with Skanderbeg as commander, but the
          Pope’s death halted the effort. His death in January 1468 weakened Albanian resistance, leading to Ottoman control
          by 1479.
        </p>
        <p>
          These alliances extended his struggle, linking Albania to broader European conflicts.

        <h2>Legacy and Cultural Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Skanderbeg’s 25-year defiance left a lasting legacy, delaying Ottoman consolidation in the Balkans. Celebrated as a 
          national hero during the Albanian National Awakening in the 19th century, he is commemorated with statues, museums,
          and the Order of Skanderbeg award. His life inspired works like Marin Barleti’s *Historia de vita et
          gestis Scanderbegi* (1508) and modern cultural depictions, including films and operas. Internationally,
          he is remembered as a symbol of resistance, influencing Albanian identity and European narratives of the Ottoman era.
        </p>
        <p>
          Skanderbeg remains an enduring icon of courage and unity in Albanian and world history.
