        <h2>Who Was Adolf Hitler?</h2>
        <p>
          Adolf Hitler’s ascent to power began in 1919, when he joined the German Workers’ Party (DAP) in the Weimar Republic,
          a fragile democracy established after World War I. Rising quickly due to his oratory skills, Hitler became the DAP’s 
          leader by 1921, renaming it the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (NSDAP), or Nazi Party. Over the next decade,
          he transformed the party into a dominant political force, exploiting economic crises, nationalist resentment, and
          fear of communism to become Germany’s Chancellor in 1933. By 1934, he consolidated absolute power as Führer,
          establishing a totalitarian regime.
        </p>
        <p>
          His rise marked a dark turning point, leading to World War II and the Holocaust.

        <h2>Early Years and Nazi Party Growth</h2>
        <p>
          Hitler joined the DAP in 1919, drawn to its nationalist and anti-Semitic rhetoric. By 1920, he rebranded it as
          the Nazi Party to appeal to workers, blending right-wing ideology with anti-capitalist elements—though he later
          purged these to secure business support. In 1923, the failed Beer Hall Putsch, an attempted coup in Munich,
          brought him national attention. Arrested and sentenced to five years, he served only eight months, using the time to
          write *Mein Kampf*, which outlined his ideology of racial supremacy and territorial expansion. Released in 1924, 
          Hitler shifted to legal means, leveraging his growing fame to rebuild the party.
        </p>
        <p>
          These early setbacks paradoxically strengthened his political platform.

        <h2>Exploiting Crisis and Political Maneuvering</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout the 1920s, the Nazis campaigned on anti-communism, anti-Semitism, and opposition to the
          Treaty of Versailles, but gained little traction amid Germany’s economic recovery under the Dawes Plan. The 1929 Wall
          Street Crash changed everything, plunging Germany into the Great Depression. With unemployment soaring, Hitler’s 
          attacks on the Weimar government resonated. The Nazi Party surged in the 1930 elections, and by 1932, held the most
          Reichstag seats. After losing the presidential election to Paul von Hindenburg, Hitler was appointed Chancellor on
          January 30, 1933, following pressure from industrialists and political elites fearing a communist uprising.
        </p>
        <p>
          Economic despair and political instability were key catalysts for his rise.
        </p>

        <h2>Consolidation of Power</h2>
        <p>
          As Chancellor, Hitler moved swiftly to dismantle democracy. The Reichstag fire in February 1933, blamed on communists,
          led to the Reichstag Fire Decree, suspending civil liberties. The Enabling Act of March 1933 allowed his government to
          enact laws without parliamentary approval, effectively granting dictatorial powers. Hitler banned opposition parties, 
          opened the first concentration camp at Dachau for political prisoners, and orchestrated violent street clashes through
          the Nazi SA against communist groups like the Rotfrontkämpferbund. Following Hindenburg’s death in August 1934, Hitler
          merged the Chancellorship and Presidency, declaring himself Führer and establishing absolute control.
        </p>
        <p>
          These steps cemented the Nazi dictatorship, erasing democratic institutions.
        </p>

        <h2>Legacy and Historical Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Hitler’s rise was fueled by his strategic use of violence, propaganda, and alliances with business elites, who saw
          him as a bulwark against communism. The Nazis later mythologized this period as the *Kampfzeit* (time of struggle), 
          glorifying their ascent. His regime initiated aggressive expansion, leading to World War II and the Holocaust, which
          claimed millions of lives. The period remains a stark lesson in how economic crises, political opportunism, and
          extremist ideologies can undermine democracy, influencing modern studies on authoritarianism and propaganda.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hitler’s ascent continues to serve as a warning of the dangers of unchecked power.
