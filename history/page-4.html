        <h2>What Were the Napoleonic Wars?</h2>
        <p>
          The Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815) were a series of global conflicts led by Napoleon I of France against
          shifting coalitions of European powers. Emerging from the unresolved tensions of the French Revolution and the
          earlier Revolutionary Wars (1792–1802), these wars saw France dominate much of continental Europe. Spanning
          multiple coalitions—Third (1803–1806), Fourth (1806–1807), Fifth (1809), Sixth (1813–1814), and Seventh (1815), 
          alongside the Peninsular War (1807–1814) and the 1812 Russian invasion—the conflicts reshaped military
          strategy, politics, and society, ending with Napoleon’s defeat and exile.

          This era of French hegemony left a lasting imprint on European and global history.

        <h2>Rise of Napoleon and Early Victories</h2>
        <p>
          Ascending to First Consul in 1799, Napoleon inherited a fractured French Republic and swiftly stabilized its finances,
          bureaucracy, and military. His early triumphs included the stunning victory at Austerlitz (December 1805), where he 
          crushed the Russo-Austrian army, cementing his reputation as a military genius. However, Britain’s naval dominance was
          secured at Trafalgar (October 1805), thwarting any invasion plans. Alarmed by French expansion, Prussia formed the 
          Fourth Coalition with Russia, Saxony, and Sweden, but Napoleon’s swift defeats at Jena and Friedland (1806–1807)
          forced an uneasy peace. The Fifth Coalition, led by Austria, briefly succeeded at Aspern-Essling but fell at
          Wagram (1809).
        </p>
        <p>
          These victories showcased Napoleon’s tactical brilliance, though his overreach soon became evident.

        <h2>Expansion and Setbacks</h2>
        <p>
          To weaken Britain economically, Napoleon imposed the Continental System, blocking trade with his enemies. This led to 
          the invasion of Portugal (1807) and the Peninsular War, where he installed his brother Joseph as King of Spain (1808).
          Spanish and Portuguese resistance, backed by Britain, expelled the French by 1814 after six years of guerrilla warfar.
          Simultaneously, Russia’s violation of the Continental System prompted the disastrous 1812 invasion, where the Grande 
          Armée faced catastrophic losses from Russian scorched-earth tactics and winter conditions, marking a turning point.
        </p>
        <p>
          These campaigns highlighted the limits of Napoleon’s ambition and the resilience of his adversaries.

        <h2>Downfall and Final Campaigns</h2>
        <p>
          Emboldened by Russia’s defeat, the Sixth Coalition (Austria, Prussia, Sweden, Russia) crushed Napoleon at Leipzig 
          (October 1813), known as the “Battle of Nations.” Allied forces invaded France, capturing Paris in March 1814, forcing
          Napoleon’s abdication and exile to Elba. His return during the Hundred Days (February–June 1815) ended with defeat at 
          Waterloo by the Seventh Coalition, led by Britain and Prussia. Exiled to Saint Helena, he died in 1821, concluding his
          era of dominance.
        </p>
        <p>
          This collapse marked the end of French hegemony and the beginning of a new European order.

        <h2>Legacy and Global Impact</h2>
        <p>
          The Congress of Vienna (1815) redrew Europe’s map, establishing a fragile peace until the Crimean War (1853). The wars
          fueled nationalism and liberalism, inspiring independence movements in Latin America that weakened Spanish and 
          Portuguese empires. They also unified German and Italian territories into modern states and introduced
          innovations like conscription and civil law codes (e.g., Napoleonic Code). Britain emerged as a naval and
          economic superpower, while military tactics evolved, influencing future conflicts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Napoleonic Wars remain a cornerstone of modern European identity and governance.
