        <h2>What Was the Vietnam War?</h2>
        <p>
          The Vietnam War (1955–1975) was a protracted conflict in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, officially fought
          between communist North Vietnam, supported by the Soviet Union and China, and anti-communist South Vietnam, backed by 
          the United States and its allies. As a Cold War-era proxy war, it spanned nearly two decades, with direct
          U.S. involvement ending in 1973. The war extended into neighboring states, intensifying the Laotian and
          Cambodian Civil Wars, and culminated in communist victories across all three nations by 1975, with the fall of
          Saigon on April 30 marking the conflict’s end.

        <p>
          This war became a defining moment of Cold War tensions and anti-war movements globally.

        <h2>Origins and Escalation</h2>
        <p>
          After France’s withdrawal from Indochina in 1954, following defeat in the First Indochina War, the
          Viet Minh established control over North Vietnam, while the U.S. supported the South Vietnamese state.
          The North-backed Viet Cong launched a guerrilla campaign in the South, escalating into conventional warfare by
          the North Vietnamese Army (PAVN). U.S. involvement grew under President Kennedy, with troop numbers rising from
          under 1,000 advisors in 1959 to 23,000 by 1964. 
          The Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964 prompted a U.S. Congressional resolution, enabling President Johnson to deploy 
          combat units, peaking at 184,000 troops by 1965.
        </p>
        <p>
          These early steps drew the U.S. deeper into a complex and divisive conflict.

        <h2>Major Campaigns and Turning Points</h2>
        <p>
          The U.S. and South Vietnamese forces relied on air superiority and firepower, conducting search-and-destroy operations
          and extensive bombing campaigns against North Vietnam, including supply routes like the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos and 
          Cambodia. The 1968 Tet Offensive, though a military failure for the North, eroded U.S. public support,
          shifting the war’s political tide. President Nixon’s “Vietnamization” policy from 1969 aimed to transfer combat
          duties to South Vietnamese forces, with U.S. troops largely withdrawn by 1972. The Paris Peace Accords of 1973
          briefly halted U.S. involvement, but fighting resumed, leading to the fall of Phnom Penh and Saigon in 1975.
        </p>
        <p>
          These events highlighted the limits of military might against determined guerrilla resistance.

        <h2>Regional Impact and Human Cost</h2>
        <p>
          The war devastated Southeast Asia, with millions killed—estimates range from 1 to 3 million Vietnamese, alongside 
          hundreds of thousands in Laos and Cambodia. U.S. bombing campaigns, including the use of Agent Orange, caused
          long-term environmental and health damage. The conflict destabilized the region, enabling the Khmer Rouge’s
          genocidal regime in Cambodia and exacerbating civil wars in Laos. Over 58,000 U.S. soldiers died, and the
          war’s brutality, including incidents like the My Lai Massacre, fueled global outrage and anti-war protests.
        </p>
        <p>
          The human toll left scars that persist across generations.

        <h2>Legacy and Global Significance</h2>
        <p>
          The Vietnam War reshaped global politics, marking a rare U.S. military defeat and diminishing its international 
          credibility during the Cold War. Vietnam’s reunification under communism in 1976 solidified the North’s victory, while
          the war’s fallout influenced U.S. foreign policy, leading to the “Vietnam Syndrome” of caution in military
          interventions. Culturally, it inspired films like *Apocalypse Now* and anti-war movements, while its lessons
          on guerrilla warfare and public opinion continue to inform modern conflicts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The war remains a powerful symbol of resistance, division, and the costs of ideological battles.
