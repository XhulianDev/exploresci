        <h2>What Was World War I?</h2>
        <p>
          World War I, often called the “Great War,” raged from July 28, 1914, to November 11, 1918, as a devastating global 
          conflict involving Europe, the Russian Empire, the United States, and the Ottoman Empire. Combat spanned Europe, the 
          Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia, driven by new technologies like airplanes, trench warfare and
          chemical weapons. 
          This made it one of history’s deadliest wars, with an estimated 9 million soldiers and 5 million civilians lost to 
          combat, famine, disease, and genocides within the Ottoman Empire, worsened by the 1918 influenza pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The war reshaped global politics, economies, and societies, setting the stage for the 20th century’s upheavals.

        <h2>Origins and Alliances</h2>
        <p>
          By 1914, Europe’s great powers were split into two rival blocs: the Triple Entente (France, Russia, Britain) and the 
          Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy). Tensions escalated in the Balkans after the June 28, 1914, 
          assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb. Austria-Hungary’s declaration of war on 
          Serbia triggered the July Crisis, a failed diplomatic effort to avert conflict. Russia’s support for Serbia drew in 
          Germany, France, and Britain by August 4, while Italy stayed neutral. The Central Powers (Ottoman Empire, Germany, 
          Austria-Hungary) and Allies (Britain, France, Russia, later Italy) formed by 1915.

        <h2>Key Campaigns and Strategies</h2>
        <p>
          Germany’s Schlieffen Plan aimed for a quick victory in France before turning east to Russia, but it stalled at the 
          First Battle of the Marne, leading to the entrenched Western Front from the English Channel to Switzerland.
          The Eastern Front saw more movement, with Russia and Austria-Hungary trading vast territories. Other theaters
          included the Middle 
          East, where Allied campaigns against the Ottomans faltered, and the Italian and Balkan fronts, drawing in Bulgaria and
          Romania. Major battles like Verdun (1916) and the Somme (1916) inflicted massive casualties with little strategic
          gain.

        <p>
          These grueling campaigns exposed the brutal reality of industrialized warfare.

        <h2>Turning Points and Collapse</h2>
        <p>
          By 1917, the war’s toll was immense. Germany’s unrestricted submarine warfare brought the U.S. into the conflict on 
          April 6, while Russia’s Bolshevik Revolution led to its exit via the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (March 1918). Germany’s 
          1918 Spring Offensive on the Western Front gained ground but exhausted resources. The Allies’ Hundred Days Offensive 
          (August–November 1918) broke German lines, as the Central Powers crumbled: Bulgaria surrendered on September 29, the 
          Ottomans on October 31, and Austria-Hungary on November 3. Facing revolution at home, Kaiser Wilhelm abdicated, and 
          Germany signed the Armistice on November 11, 1918.
        </p>
        <p>
          The war ended, but its scars were far from healed.

        <h2>Legacy and Global Impact</h2>
        <p>
          The Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920) imposed harsh terms, notably the Treaty of Versailles, on the defeated powers, 
          fueling resentment in Germany. The war dissolved empires—Russian, German, Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian—birthing new
          states like Poland and Yugoslavia. It also set the stage for World War II, as unresolved tensions and economic 
          instability festered during the interwar years. Socially, the war advanced women’s roles, spurred technological
          innovation, and reshaped cultural narratives, evident in literature like Erich Maria Remarque’s <em>All Quiet on the
          Western Front</em>.

        <p>
          World War I remains a pivotal moment, its lessons echoing in modern geopolitics.
