        <h2>What Was the First Balkan War?</h2>
        <p>
          The First Balkan War (1912–1913) was a conflict pitting the Balkan League—comprising Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, and 
          Bulgaria—against the Ottoman Empire. Fueled by nationalist aspirations to reclaim Ottoman-controlled territories in 
          Rumelia (Eastern Rumelia, Thrace, and Macedonia), the war began on October 8, 1912, with Montenegro’s declaration of 
          war, followed by the other League members on October 17. The Balkan League’s swift victories dismantled Ottoman rule
          in the region, but unresolved territorial disputes among the allies soon led to the Second Balkan War.
        </p>
        <p>
          This conflict marked a critical step in the decline of Ottoman influence in Europe.

        <h2>Origins and Regional Tensions</h2>
        <p>
          By the late 19th century, the Balkans were a hotbed of nationalist fervor, with Serbia and Montenegro gaining 
          independence by 1878 under the Treaty of Berlin. The Young Turk Revolution of 1908, which aimed to reform the Ottoman 
          Empire, instead destabilized the region by resettling Muslim Bosnians in Macedonia, fueling Albanian unrest in 
          1911–1912. Serbia, frustrated by Austria’s 1908 annexation of Bosnia, turned its ambitions south, while Greece
          sought to reverse its 1897 defeat to the Ottomans. Bulgaria, styling itself the “Prussia of the Balkans,”
          aimed to unify Macedonia under its control, setting the stage for a united Balkan offensive.
        </p>
        <p>
          These tensions, combined with Ottoman weakness, ignited the war.

        <h2>Formation of the Balkan League</h2>
        <p>
          Inspired by Italy’s 1911 victories over the Ottomans in Libya, the Balkan states formed the Balkan League through a 
          series of alliances, culminating in a Serbia-Montenegro agreement on March 7, 1912. Serbia and Bulgaria agreed
          to divide Macedonia, with Bulgaria taking the south and Serbia the north, while Greece, under Eleftherios Venizelos, 
          joined to secure Aegean territories like Thessaloniki. Despite attempts by Great Powers like France and
          Austria-Hungary to prevent conflict, the League mobilized in September 1912, declaring war after issuing an
          ultimatum the Ottomans could not meet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The League’s unity, though temporary, proved formidable against a weakened Ottoman Empire.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Key Campaigns and Outcomes</h2>
        <p>
          The Balkan League launched coordinated offensives, with Serbia advancing through Kosovo, Montenegro targeting Shkodër,
          Greece capturing Thessaloniki just hours before Bulgarian forces arrived, and Bulgaria securing Thrace. By
          November 1912, the Ottomans were pushed back to defensive lines near Constantinople. The war attracted
          global attention, with 200–300 correspondents covering the conflict. The Treaty of London (May 1913) ended the war, 
          ceding most Ottoman territories to the League, but Serbia’s failure to secure Albanian support—contrary to
          King Peter I’s declaration of unity—sowed seeds of discord among the allies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rapid victories exposed both Ottoman vulnerabilities and Balkan rivalries.

        <h2>Legacy and Historical Impact</h2>
        <p>
          The First Balkan War significantly reduced Ottoman presence in Europe, redistributing territories among the
          Balkan states and creating an independent Albania. However, the League’s inability to agree on territorial
          divisions, particularly over Macedonia, led to the Second Balkan War in 1913. The conflict inspired
          nationalist movements across the region, influencing the lead-up to World War I, and highlighted the fragility
          of imperial rule in the face of coordinated uprisings. Culturally, it left a legacy in Balkan literature and
          oral histories, celebrating victories while mourning the ensuing conflicts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The war remains a pivotal moment in Balkan history, shaping modern national borders.
