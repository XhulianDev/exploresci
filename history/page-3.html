        <h2>What Was the October Revolution?</h2>
        <p>
          The October Revolution, also known as the Bolshevik Revolution, was a pivotal uprising in Russia led by
          Vladimir Lenin’s Bolshevik Party. Occurring on November 7, 1917 (October 25 in the Julian calendar), it marked
          the second phase of the Russian Revolution of 1917–1923. Through an armed insurrection in Petrograd
          (now Saint Petersburg), the Bolsheviks overthrew the Provisional Government, seizing key institutions like the
          Winter Palace. This event triggered the Russian Civil War and led to the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922.
        </p>
        <p>
          The revolution reshaped global politics, inspiring communist movements and redefining the 20th-century
          ideological landscape.

        <h2>Origins and Context</h2>
        <p>
          The October Revolution followed the February Revolution of 1917, which had ended Tsarist rule and established
          a liberal Provisional Government. However, the new government, led initially by Grand Duke Michael and later by
          the Socialist Revolutionary Party, failed to address deep societal unrest. Russia’s continued involvement in
          World War I, coupled with severe food shortages and economic collapse, alienated urban workers and peasants.
          Factory workers organized into soviets (councils), which became hotbeds of revolutionary dissent, while
          the government’s harsh response—such as the violent suppression during the July Days—further eroded its legitimacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          This mounting discontent created fertile ground for the Bolsheviks’ radical agenda.

        <h2>Key Events and Uprising</h2>
        <p>
          By autumn 1917, the Bolsheviks, under Lenin and Leon Trotsky, gained momentum. On October 10 (O.S.), the Petrograd 
          Soviet, led by Trotsky, voted for a military uprising. The government’s attempt to suppress dissent by
          closing newspapers and isolating Petrograd failed. On October 24 (O.S.), minor skirmishes erupted, escalating
          the next day as Bolshevik sailors and soldiers joined the cause. Red Guards, coordinated by the
          Military-Revolutionary Committee, occupied key government buildings. On November 7 (O.S. October 25), they stormed
          the Winter Palace, arresting the Provisional Government and declaring Soviet rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          This swift, organized coup marked a turning point in Russia’s revolutionary struggle.

        <h2>Social Dynamics and Unrest</h2>
        <p>
          The revolution was fueled by widespread social discontent. Urban workers, facing food shortages and poor living 
          conditions, organized mass strikes—over a million participated in September and October alone, from Moscow to
          the Urals. Factory committees seized control of production, reflecting a grassroots social revolution.
          In rural areas, peasants rebelled against landlords, with uprisings spreading to 77% of counties by autumn.
          Soldiers’ wives, burdened by wartime losses and inadequate government support, led “hunger riots,” seizing
          resources to protest unfair prices. These movements underscored the deep class divides driving the revolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bolsheviks capitalized on this unrest, positioning themselves as champions of the oppressed.

        <h2>Legacy and Global Impact</h2>
        <p>
          The October Revolution sparked the Russian Civil War (1917–1923), culminating in the Soviet Union’s formation. The 
          Bolshevik victory was celebrated in Soviet historiography as a triumph of socialism, with Revolution Day becoming a 
          national holiday. Globally, it inspired communist movements, influencing figures like Mao Zedong and igniting
          Marxist-Leninist parties worldwide. However, Western powers viewed it as a totalitarian coup, criticizing
          the Bolsheviks’ eventual suppression of democratic soviets. Culturally, it inspired works like Eisenstein’s
          <em>October</em> and fueled debates on socialism versus capitalism that defined the 20th century.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its legacy remains a contested symbol of revolution and ideological struggle.
