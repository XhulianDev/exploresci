        <h2>What Was the Spanish Civil War?</h2>
        <p>
          The Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), known as *Guerra Civil Española*, was a brutal conflict between the Republicans, 
          loyal to the left-leaning Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic, and the Nationalists, a coalition
          of Falangists, monarchists, and conservatives led by General Francisco Franco. Encompassing socialists, communists, 
          anarchists, and separatists, the Republicans faced a military uprising that evolved into a struggle framed as a clash 
          of ideologies—class, religion, democracy versus dictatorship, and fascism versus communism. Often called a “dress 
          rehearsal” for World War II by U.S. Ambassador Claude Bowers, the war ended with a Nationalist victory in 1939,
          ushering in Franco’s dictatorship until his death in 1975.

          This conflict left a lasting mark on Spain and influenced global political alignments.

        <h2>Origins and Escalation</h2>
        <p>
          The war erupted on July 17, 1936, following a military pronunciamiento led by General Emilio Mola, with General José 
          Sanjurjo as a figurehead, against the Republican government under President Manuel Azaña. The Republicans, a coalition
          of leftist parties, struggled to govern amid economic instability and political polarization following the fall of
          the monarchy in 1931. The Nationalists, backed by conservative groups like the CEDA, Carlists, and Falange Española, 
          capitalized on this unrest. After Sanjurjo’s death in a plane crash and Mola’s later demise, Franco emerged as the 
          Nationalist leader, consolidating power as the coup divided Spain geographically and ideologically.
        </p>
        <p>
          The coup’s partial success ignited a war that reflected deep societal divisions.

        <h2>Major Campaigns and Foreign Involvement</h2>
        <p>
          The Nationalists seized control of Morocco, Pamplona, and parts of northern Spain, while Republican strongholds like 
          Madrid and Barcelona held firm, creating a fractured front. The Nationalists received significant support from Fascist
          Italy and Nazi Germany, including troops and air forces (e.g., the Condor Legion), while the Soviets and Mexico aided 
          the Republicans with arms and advisors. Despite a non-intervention policy by Britain, France, and the U.S., thousands 
          joined the pro-Republican International Brigades, including exiles from authoritarian regimes. By 1937, the
          Nationalists captured northern Spain, and after Barcelona fell in 1939, the Republican cause collapsed, with
          Franco entering Madrid on April 1, 1939.
        </p>
        <p>
          Foreign intervention transformed the war into a proxy battleground for broader ideological wars.
        </p>

        <h2>Atrocities and Social Impact</h2>
        <p>
          The war was marked by widespread atrocities on both sides. Nationalist forces conducted systematic purges in captured 
          territories, executing thousands to consolidate Franco’s regime. Republicans, in turn, carried out mass killings, 
          though with varying local involvement, targeting clergy and landowners. Hundreds of thousands fled to French
          refugee camps, while those who remained faced persecution under Franco’s dictatorship, which merged all right-wing 
          factions into a single authoritarian structure. The conflict displaced families, destroyed communities, and
          entrenched political divisions for decades.
        </p>
        <p>
          These acts of violence underscored the war’s profound human and social cost.

        <h2>Legacy and Historical Significance</h2>
        <p>
          The Nationalist victory established Franco’s 36-year dictatorship, shaping Spain’s political isolation and economic 
          recovery challenges post-war. Globally, the war tested international alliances, foreshadowing World War II’s 
          ideological battles. It inspired cultural works like Picasso’s *Guernica*, reflecting the bombing’s horror, and
          fueled debates on fascism and democracy. The conflict’s legacy persists in Spain’s memory, with ongoing efforts
          to uncover mass graves and address historical justice, while its international echoes influenced
          anti-fascist movements worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Spanish Civil War remains a poignant lesson in the fragility of democracy and the power of ideology.
