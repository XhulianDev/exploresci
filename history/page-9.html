        <h2>What Was the Second Balkan War?</h2>
        <p>
          The Second Balkan War (June–July 1913) was a brief but intense conflict among the former allies of the
          Balkan League—Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, and Montenegro—following their victory over the Ottoman Empire in the
          First Balkan War. Disputes over the division of territorial gains, particularly in Macedonia, led Bulgaria to
          attack Serbia and Greece on June 29, 1913. The war ended with Bulgaria’s defeat, as Romania and the Ottoman Empire 
          also joined against it, resulting in significant territorial losses for Bulgaria under the Treaty of
          Bucharest (August 1913).

          This conflict deepened Balkan rivalries, setting the stage for World War I.

        <h2>Origins and Territorial Disputes</h2>
        <p>
          The First Balkan War concluded with the Treaty of London (May 1913), granting the Balkan League control over
          most Ottoman territories west of the Enos–Midia line, including Macedonia. However, a pre-war agreement between
          Serbia and Bulgaria (March 1912) to divide Macedonia—with Bulgaria taking the south and Serbia the
          north—unraveled when Serbia captured more territory than agreed, reaching the Bitola–Gevgelija line.
          Greece’s occupation of Thessaloniki further complicated matters. Serbia, forced by the Great Powers to cede
          northern Albania, refused to relinquish its Macedonian gains, while Bulgaria insisted on enforcing the
          original partition, leading to irreconcilable tensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          These disputes turned allies into adversaries within weeks of their shared victory.

        <h2>Escalation and Alliances</h2>
        <p>
          Anticipating Bulgarian aggression, Serbia and Greece signed a secret defensive alliance on June 1, 1913,
          securing their mutual border in Macedonia and pledging support against Bulgaria or Austria-Hungary. Bulgaria,
          under Prime Minister Geshov, initially sought a diplomatic solution by agreeing to Greek control over
          southern Macedonia, but his dismissal halted negotiations. Tensions also arose with Romania over Bulgaria’s refusal
          to cede Silistra, resolved through Russian arbitration in the Protocol of St. Petersburg (May 1913). However,
          Russia’s failure to mediate the Serbian-Bulgarian dispute led Bulgaria to lose faith in Russian support, isolating
          it further.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bulgaria’s diplomatic missteps left it vulnerable to a multi-front war.

        <h2>The War and Its Outcome</h2>
        <p>
          On June 29, 1913, Bulgaria launched a surprise attack on Serbian and Greek positions in Macedonia, hoping for a quick 
          victory. However, Serbia and Greece, now allied, repelled the offensive. Romania joined the conflict, seeking
          Silistra, while the Ottoman Empire re-entered to reclaim Eastern Thrace. Outnumbered, Bulgaria faced rapid defeats,
          losing key territories within weeks. The Treaty of Bucharest (August 10, 1913) stripped Bulgaria of most of
          its Macedonian gains, ceding land to Serbia, Greece, and Romania, while the Ottomans regained Eastern Thrace under
          the Treaty of Constantinople.
        </p>
        <p>
          The war’s brevity belied its devastating impact on Bulgaria and regional stability.

        <h2>Legacy and Historical Impact</h2>
        <p>
          The Second Balkan War entrenched divisions in the Balkans, fueling nationalist resentments that contributed to
          World War I. 
          Bulgaria’s territorial losses fostered a desire for revenge, aligning it with the Central Powers in 1915.
          The war also solidified Serbia and Greece as regional powers, while the reassertion of Ottoman control in Thrace 
          delayed their decline in Europe. Culturally, the conflict inspired literature and songs reflecting national pride and 
          loss, while its lessons on alliance fragility influenced Balkan politics for decades.
        </p>
        <p>
          This war remains a cautionary tale of the perils of unchecked territorial ambition.
