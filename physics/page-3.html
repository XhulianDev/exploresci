        <h2>What Is Electromagnetism?</h2>
        <p>
          Electromagnetism, one of the four fundamental forces of nature alongside gravity, the strong nuclear force, and the 
          weak nuclear force, is the branch of physics that studies the interactions between electrically charged particles and 
          magnetic fields. It governs phenomena like light, electricity, and magnetism, shaping both natural processes and 
          technological advancements. Emerging in the 19th century, it unifies electric and magnetic effects into a single 
          framework, influencing everything from household appliances to modern communication systems as of May 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
          This field is essential for understanding the physical world and driving innovation.

        <h2>Historical Foundations</h2>
        <p>
          The study of electromagnetism began with Hans Christian Ørsted’s 1820 discovery that an electric current deflects a 
          magnetic needle, linking electricity and magnetism. This paved the way for the electromagnet, a device using current 
          to generate magnetic fields. James Clerk Maxwell revolutionized the field in the 1860s with his four equations, 
          published in *A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism* (1873), which unified these phenomena and predicted 
          electromagnetic waves. Building on Michael Faraday’s work on induction, Maxwell’s equations laid the theoretical 
          foundation for modern physics.
        </p>
        <p>
          These milestones transformed electromagnetism into a cohesive science.

        <h2>Maxwell’s Equations</h2>
        <p>
          Maxwell’s equations form the backbone of electromagnetism. Gauss’s law for electric fields states that electric flux 
          through a closed surface equals the enclosed charge divided by the permittivity of free space (ε₀). Gauss’s law for 
          magnetic fields asserts that magnetic flux through any closed surface is zero, reflecting the absence of magnetic 
          monopoles. Faraday’s law of induction describes how a changing magnetic field induces an electric field, while 
          Ampère’s law with Maxwell’s correction shows that a changing electric field induces a magnetic field. Together, these 
          equations predict electromagnetic wave propagation at the speed of light (c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s).
        </p>
        <p>
          They provide a mathematical framework for understanding electromagnetic phenomena.

        <h2>Electromagnetic Waves and Properties</h2>
        <p>
          Electromagnetic waves, consisting of oscillating electric and magnetic fields, span a spectrum from radio waves to 
          gamma rays. Their wavelength (λ) and frequency (f) are related by c = λf, where c is the speed of light. Frequency, 
          measured in hertz (Hz), determines energy (E = hν, where h is Planck’s constant and ν is frequency), influencing 
          properties like penetration or visibility. These waves enable technologies like Wi-Fi and X-ray imaging, and natural 
          phenomena like sunlight, bridging classical and quantum physics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their versatility drives both scientific inquiry and practical applications.

        <h2>Applications and Modern Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Electromagnetism powers modern technology. Electric generators convert mechanical energy into electricity, fueling 
          power plants, while electric motors drive machinery and electric vehicles. Telecommunications rely on radio waves and 
          microwaves for global connectivity, exemplified by 5G networks in 2025. In science, it explains atomic electron 
          behavior, crucial for chemistry and materials science. Ongoing research explores quantum electromagnetism and 
          sustainable energy, leveraging these principles to address contemporary challenges like renewable power generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its influence continues to shape technology and our understanding of the universe.
