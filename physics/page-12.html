        <h2>What Are Electromagnetic Waves?</h2>
        <p>
          Electromagnetic waves are oscillations of electric and magnetic fields that propagate through space, carrying energy 
          across vast distances. Governed by Maxwell’s equations, they exhibit a dual nature—behaving as both waves
          and particles (photons), a concept rooted in quantum mechanics’ wave-particle duality. From powering
          communication systems to enabling medical imaging, electromagnetic waves are integral to modern technology and
          our understanding of the universe as of May 
          2025.

        <h2>Historical Development</h2>
        <p>
          The concept of electromagnetic waves emerged in the 19th century when James Clerk Maxwell formulated his equations, 
          unifying electricity and magnetism in 1865. Maxwell predicted that these fields could oscillate together, traveling at
          the speed of light (c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s), a theory confirmed by Heinrich Hertz in 1887 with the generation of radio waves.
          The 20th century saw further advancements, with Albert Einstein’s 1905 photoelectric effect revealing the particle 
          nature of light, solidifying their dual behavior.

        <h2>Properties and the Electromagnetic Spectrum</h2>
        <p>
          Electromagnetic waves are defined by their wavelength (distance between wave peaks) and frequency (waves per second), 
          related by the equation c = λf, where c is the speed of light. The electromagnetic spectrum spans radio waves (longest
          wavelength, lowest frequency) to gamma rays (shortest wavelength, highest frequency), including microwaves, infrared, 
          visible light, ultraviolet, and X-rays. Each region has distinct properties: radio waves enable communication, visible
          light allows sight, and gamma rays penetrate matter for medical applications.

        <h2>Generation and Interactions</h2>
        <p>
          Electromagnetic waves are generated by accelerating charged particles, such as electrons oscillating in an antenna 
          (radio waves) or atomic transitions in the sun (visible light). They interact with matter through absorption, 
          reflection, or transmission, depending on the material and wave frequency—X-rays, for instance, pass through
          soft tissue but are absorbed by bones. Maxwell’s equations mathematically describe these interactions,
          providing a framework for understanding wave propagation and energy transfer.

        <h2>Applications and Modern Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Electromagnetic waves drive critical technologies. Radio waves and microwaves power wireless communication, including 
          5G networks and satellite systems as of May 2025. Infrared and visible light enable fiber-optic internet and 
          photography, while ultraviolet sterilizes medical equipment, and X-rays and gamma rays facilitate medical imaging
          (MRI, CT scans) and cancer therapy. Ongoing research into terahertz waves promises advancements in security
          scanning and high-speed data transfer, highlighting their continued relevance.
