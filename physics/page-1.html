        <h2>What Is Mechanics?</h2>
        <p>
          Mechanics, a cornerstone of physics, examines the behavior of physical systems through the lens of motion, force, and 
          energy. Originating in ancient Greece with thinkers like Aristotle and Archimedes, it evolved into a rigorous science 
          by the 17th century. Mechanics encompasses the study of objects—whether at rest, in linear motion, rotating, 
          oscillating, or transmitting waves—and the forces driving these phenomena. It forms the foundation for understanding 
          everything from planetary orbits to the design of modern machinery.
        </p>
        <p>
          This field remains essential for physicists, engineers, and scientists across disciplines.

        <h2>Newton’s Laws of Motion</h2>
        <p>
          Sir Isaac Newton’s three laws of motion, published in 1687 in *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*, are the 
          bedrock of classical mechanics. The First Law, or law of inertia, states that an object remains at rest or in uniform 
          motion unless acted upon by an external force. The Second Law quantifies this relationship with the equation F = ma, 
          where force (F) equals mass (m) times acceleration (a), showing that acceleration depends on the net force and 
          inversely on mass. The Third Law asserts that every action has an equal and opposite reaction, illustrating
          force interactions between objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          These laws explain a wide range of physical phenomena, from falling apples to orbiting planets.

        <h2>Applications of Newton’s Laws</h2>
        <p>
          Newton’s laws have far-reaching applications. In astronomy, they enable precise predictions of planetary motion, as 
          seen in Johannes Kepler’s laws refined by Newton’s gravitational theory. In engineering, they guide the design of 
          structures like bridges, ensuring they withstand forces such as wind or gravity. Projectile motion—whether a
          soccer ball, bullet, or rocket—relies on these laws to calculate trajectories and velocities. Everyday
          examples include vehicle dynamics, where engineers apply F = ma to optimize acceleration and braking systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          These principles bridge theoretical physics with practical innovation.
        </p>

        <h2>Rotational Motion, Oscillations, and Waves</h2>
        <p>
          Mechanics extends beyond linear motion. Rotational motion, like a spinning wheel, involves torque (rotational force), 
          angular acceleration, and moment of inertia, mirroring Newton’s laws in angular form. Oscillatory motion, such as a 
          pendulum’s swing, follows simple harmonic motion principles, described by equations like x(t) = A cos(ωt), where A is 
          amplitude and ω is angular frequency. Wave motion governs phenomena like sound and water waves, modeled by wave 
          equations that describe propagation, interference, and resonance, fundamental to fields like acoustics and optics.
        </p>
        <p>
          These concepts deepen our understanding of complex physical systems.

        <h2>Significance and Modern Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Mechanics underpins advancements in science and technology. It informs space exploration, enabling missions like
          the Mars rovers by predicting trajectories under gravitational forces. In robotics, engineers use mechanics to design
          stable, efficient movements. The field also intersects with modern physics—classical mechanics transitions into 
          quantum mechanics for microscopic systems and relativity for high speeds. Culturally, Newton’s legacy inspires 
          educational curricula and popular science, emphasizing the timeless relevance of understanding motion and forces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mechanics continues to drive innovation and curiosity in the physical sciences.
