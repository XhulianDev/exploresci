        <h2>What Is Thermodynamics?</h2>
        <p>
          Thermodynamics is a core branch of physics that investigates heat, temperature, and their interplay with work and 
          energy. Emerging from early experiments in the 17th century, it became a distinct science in the 19th century, 
          influencing fields like engineering, chemistry, and biology. It explores how energy transforms—whether in engines, 
          chemical reactions, or natural systems—and defines the limits of these processes through laws governing conservation 
          and entropy. Its principles underpin modern technologies, from power plants to refrigeration.
        </p>
        <p>
          This field remains vital for understanding energy dynamics across disciplines.

        <h2>Historical Development</h2>
        <p>
          The roots of thermodynamics trace to the 17th century, with pioneers like Robert Boyle studying gas behavior and 
          Robert Hooke exploring elasticity. The field crystallized in the 19th century with Nicolas Carnot’s 1824 work, 
          *Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire*, introducing the Carnot cycle and laying the groundwork for the first and 
          second laws. James Joule’s experiments on heat and work (1840s) and Sadi Carnot’s efficiency concepts further refined 
          it. By the late 1800s, figures like Rudolf Clausius and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) formalized entropy and 
          thermodynamic principles, establishing it as a rigorous science.
        </p>
        <p>
          These milestones transformed thermodynamics into a cornerstone of physical science.

        <h2>Fundamental Laws</h2>
        <p>
          The first law of thermodynamics, or the law of energy conservation, states that energy is neither created nor 
          destroyed, only converted, expressed as ∆U = Q - W, where ∆U is the internal energy change, Q is heat added, and W is 
          work done. The second law introduces entropy, asserting that a closed system’s entropy increases over time or remains 
          constant in reversible processes, limiting energy’s usability. This law manifests in the Carnot cycle (maximum 
          efficiency), Clausius inequality, and Kelvin-Planck statement, guiding the direction of natural processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          These laws provide a framework for analyzing energy transformations and system efficiency.

        <h2>Thermodynamic Processes and Cycles</h2>
        <p>
          Thermodynamic processes describe energy changes in systems. An isothermal process maintains constant temperature, 
          balancing heat input with work output (∆U = 0). An adiabatic process involves no heat exchange, where work equals 
          internal energy change, often lowering temperature. An isobaric process occurs at constant pressure, with heat input 
          split between work and internal energy increase. Thermodynamic cycles, like the Carnot cycle (ideal heat engine), 
          Rankine cycle (steam power), and Otto cycle (internal combustion), return systems to initial states, optimizing
          energy conversion in engines and power plants.
        </p>
        <p>
          These concepts are critical for designing efficient energy systems.

        <h2>Applications and Modern Relevance</h2>
        <p>
          Thermodynamics drives innovations across industries. In engineering, it optimizes steam turbines in power plants 
          (Rankine cycle) and car engines (Otto cycle), improving energy efficiency. In chemistry, it predicts reaction 
          spontaneity via entropy and enthalpy changes. Biologists apply it to study metabolic processes, while climate science 
          uses it to model heat transfer in the atmosphere. Ongoing research explores advanced materials and renewable energy 
          technologies, building on thermodynamic principles to address global energy challenges as of May 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its principles continue to shape technology and sustainability efforts worldwide.
