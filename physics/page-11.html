        <h2>What Is Electrodynamics?</h2>
        <p>
          Electrodynamics explores the interactions between electric and magnetic fields and charged particles, forming a 
          cornerstone of classical and modern physics. Rooted in James Clerk Maxwell’s 19th-century equations, it explains 
          phenomena like electromagnetic wave propagation and charge dynamics. With applications spanning electrical
          engineering, telecommunications, and quantum mechanics, electrodynamics drives technologies like power systems
          and quantum computers, continuing to shape scientific advancements as of May 2025.

        <h2>Historical Development</h2>
        <p>
          Electrodynamics crystallized in the 1860s when James Clerk Maxwell unified electricity and magnetism with his four 
          equations, published in *A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism* (1873). Building on Michael Faraday’s work on 
          electromagnetic induction and André-Marie Ampère’s studies of current, Maxwell’s synthesis predicted electromagnetic 
          waves, later confirmed by Heinrich Hertz in 1887. The 20th century saw further evolution with quantum electrodynamics 
          (QED), developed by Richard Feynman and others, merging electrodynamics with quantum mechanics to describe 
          particle-field interactions.

        <h2>Core Principles</h2>
        <p>
          Maxwell’s equations underpin electrodynamics: Gauss’s law for electricity (∮E·dA = Q/ε₀) links electric fields to 
          charges; Gauss’s law for magnetism (∮B·dA = 0) indicates no magnetic monopoles exist; Faraday’s law (∮E·ds = -dΦ_B/dt) 
          describes how changing magnetic fields induce electric fields; and Ampère’s law with Maxwell’s correction 
          (∮B·ds = μ₀(I + ε₀dΦ_E/dt)) shows how currents and changing electric fields produce magnetic fields. These equations 
          reveal the interplay of fields, enabling phenomena like light propagation and electromagnetic induction.

        <h2>Applications in Technology</h2>
        <p>
          Electrodynamics powers modern technology. Electrical engineering relies on it for designing motors, generators, and 
          power grids, ensuring efficient electricity distribution. Telecommunications systems, from radios to 5G networks as of
          May 2025, use electromagnetic waves for global connectivity. In optics, Maxwell’s equations inform the design of 
          lenses, microscopes, and lasers, while metamaterials—engineered for unique electromagnetic properties—enhance 
          applications in sensing and energy harvesting, pushing technological boundaries.

        <h2>Quantum Electrodynamics and Future Directions</h2>
        <p>
          Quantum electrodynamics (QED), a 20th-century breakthrough, describes electron-photon interactions with high
          precision, predicting virtual particles that mediate forces—verified in experiments like the Lamb shift.
          QED underpins quantum computing advancements, with companies like IBM leveraging it for qubit development by May 2025.
          Future research explores electromagnetic interactions in quantum gravity and high-energy physics, aiming to
          unify fundamental forces and innovate fields like wireless energy transfer and photonics.
