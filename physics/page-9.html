        <h2>What Is Biophysics?</h2>
        <p>
          Biophysics merges physics and biology to explore the physical principles governing biological systems, from
          molecules to organisms. This interdisciplinary field applies experimental and theoretical physics to understand
          life’s processes, such as how proteins fold, cells communicate, or muscles contract. By bridging these sciences,
          biophysics provides insights into the mechanics of life and fuels advancements in medicine and technology, as of
          May 2025.

        <h2>Historical Development</h2>
        <p>
          Biophysics emerged in the mid-20th century as physics tools were increasingly applied to biology. Early milestones 
          include the 1953 discovery of DNA’s double-helix structure by Watson and Crick, aided by X-ray crystallography—a 
          biophysics technique pioneered by Rosalind Franklin. The development of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
          in the 1940s and 1950s further enabled detailed studies of biomolecular structures, laying the foundation for modern 
          biophysics and its role in molecular biology.

        <h2>Key Research Areas</h2>
        <p>
          Biophysics spans several critical domains. The study of biological macromolecules, like proteins and DNA, uses 
          techniques such as X-ray crystallography and NMR to reveal their structure and dynamics, essential for processes like 
          enzyme function. Research on biological membranes, employing fluorescence microscopy and patch-clamp methods, examines
          how cells regulate molecular transport. Cell signaling, studied through optical microscopy and electrophysiology, 
          uncovers communication mechanisms, while biomolecular motors, analyzed via optical trapping, reveal how
          chemical energy drives mechanical work in processes like muscle movement.

        <h2>Applications in Medicine and Technology</h2>
        <p>
          Biophysics significantly impacts medical technology. Structural studies of proteins inform drug design, targeting 
          diseases like cancer—recent advancements as of May 2025 include AI-driven protein modeling for drug discovery. Medical
          imaging techniques, such as MRI and CT scans, rely on biophysical principles for non-invasive diagnostics. Biophysics 
          also advances synthetic biology, designing new biological systems for applications like biofuel production, merging 
          physics and engineering to innovate healthcare and sustainability.

        <h2>Future Prospects</h2>
        <p>
          Biophysics continues to evolve with emerging technologies. Advances in single-molecule imaging and computational 
          modeling are deepening our understanding of complex systems like neural networks and protein folding, with
          implications for neurodegenerative diseases. The field is also exploring bio-inspired materials for nanotechnology,
          aiming to mimic natural processes for sustainable solutions. As biophysics grows, it promises to further
          unravel life’s physical foundations and drive transformative innovations in science and medicine.
