        <h2>Einstein’s Revolutionary Framework</h2>
        <p>
          Relativity, introduced by Albert Einstein, transformed physics by revealing that the laws of nature remain consistent 
          for all observers in uniform motion. Published in two stages—special relativity in 1905 and general relativity in 
          1915—it unifies space, time, and gravity into a cohesive theory. Special relativity addresses objects in inertial 
          frames, while general relativity incorporates gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. This 
          paradigm shift, challenging classical notions of absolute space and time, introduced concepts like time dilation and 
          mass-energy equivalence, epitomized by the equation E=mc².

        <h2>Special Relativity: Time and Energy Redefined</h2>
        <p>
          In his 1905 paper *On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies*, Einstein proposed that the speed of light (c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ 
          m/s) is constant for all observers, regardless of their motion. This led to radical implications: time dilation, where
          clocks tick slower for objects moving relative to an observer, and length contraction, where objects appear shorter 
          along the direction of motion. The iconic equation E=mc² revealed that mass and energy are interchangeable,
          a principle experimentally confirmed in nuclear reactions where small mass losses yield immense energy, as in atomic 
          bombs or power plants.

        <h2>General Relativity: Gravity as Spacetime Curvature</h2>
        <p>
          General relativity expanded this framework by describing gravity not as a force, but as the warping of spacetime by 
          mass and energy. Massive objects, like stars, curve spacetime, causing nearby objects to follow curved
          paths—explaining planetary orbits more accurately than Newton’s gravity. A striking prediction was the existence of 
          black holes, regions where spacetime curvature is so extreme that even light cannot escape. Observations, such as the
          2015 detection of gravitational waves by LIGO, and the 2019 imaging of a black hole’s shadow by the Event Horizon 
          Telescope, have validated Einstein’s theory.

        <h2>Practical Impacts and Modern Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Relativity isn’t just theoretical—it shapes technology. GPS systems rely on precise timekeeping, correcting for time 
          dilation effects: satellites in weaker gravitational fields tick faster than clocks on Earth, requiring adjustments 
          based on general relativity. In particle accelerators, like CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, relativistic effects govern 
          high-speed particle behavior, enabling discoveries like the Higgs boson. Nuclear energy harnesses E=mc², converting 
          mass into energy in reactors and stars. As of May 2025, relativity informs cosmology, guiding research into
          dark energy and the universe’s expansion.

        <h2>A New View of the Universe</h2>
        <p>
          Relativity redefined space and time as a four-dimensional spacetime fabric, warped by mass, leading to phenomena like 
          gravitational lensing—where light bends around massive objects, acting as a cosmic lens. It challenges intuition, 
          showing that time and space are relative, not absolute. Philosophically, it raises questions about causality and the 
          nature of reality, influencing fields from astrophysics to science fiction. Einstein’s theory, repeatedly confirmed 
          through experiments like the 1919 Eddington expedition observing light bending during a solar eclipse, remains a 
          cornerstone of modern physics, inspiring ongoing exploration into the cosmos.
