        <h2>What Is Fluid Mechanics?</h2>
        <p>
          Fluid mechanics examines the behavior of fluids—liquids and gases—focusing on their motion, forces, and interactions. 
          As a vital branch of physics, it splits into fluid statics (fluids at rest) and fluid dynamics (fluids in motion), 
          offering insights into phenomena from ocean currents to aircraft flight. With applications in engineering,
          meteorology, and environmental science, this field remains essential for tackling modern challenges, including
          climate modeling as of May 2025.

        <h2>Historical Foundations</h2>
        <p>
          Fluid mechanics traces back to ancient civilizations, with Archimedes’ principle of buoyancy (circa 250 BC) marking an
          early milestone. The field gained rigor in the 17th century with Evangelista Torricelli’s work on fluid pressure and 
          Isaac Newton’s studies of viscosity. In the 18th century, Daniel Bernoulli’s principle and Leonhard Euler’s equations 
          laid the groundwork for fluid dynamics. The 19th century saw Claude-Louis Navier and George Stokes refine these ideas 
          into the Navier-Stokes equations, shaping modern fluid mechanics.

        <h2>Core Principles</h2>
        <p>
          Fluid statics hinges on pressure—the force per unit area—governed by Pascal’s law, which states that pressure in a 
          confined fluid transmits uniformly, enabling hydraulic systems. Fluid dynamics explores motion types: laminar flow, 
          with smooth layers, and turbulent flow, with chaotic swirls, the latter being a focus of ongoing research. The 
          Navier-Stokes equations mathematically describe mass, momentum, and energy conservation, though their complexity often
          requires computational approximations, driving advancements in simulation technology.

        <h2>Specialized Areas</h2>
        <p>
          Aerodynamics studies gas motion, critical for designing aircraft and cars, relying on Bernoulli’s principle, where 
          faster fluid flow reduces pressure, lifting wings. Hydrodynamics focuses on liquids, shaping ship and submarine design
          through drag force analysis, which resists motion. These fields also inform weather prediction and oceanography, 
          analyzing patterns like jet streams and currents, with real-time data enhancing climate models as of late May 2025.

        <h2>Applications and Future Directions</h2>
        <p>
          Fluid mechanics underpins engineering marvels, from optimizing wind turbines to designing efficient pipelines. In 
          meteorology, it models weather systems, aiding forecasts critical during the 2025 storm season. Environmental science 
          uses it to study ocean circulation’s role in climate change. Future research, leveraging AI-driven simulations and 
          quantum computing, aims to solve the Navier-Stokes equations fully, promising breakthroughs in renewable energy and 
          space propulsion by the end of 2025.
