        <h2>What Is Quantum Mechanics?</h2>
        <p>
          Quantum mechanics, a foundational branch of physics, governs the behavior of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic
          scales. Emerging in the early 20th century, it describes particles like electrons and photons using wave 
          functions—mathematical constructs encoding their states. Unlike classical physics, it reveals a probabilistic universe
          where phenomena like superposition, uncertainty, and entanglement defy intuition. Its principles underpin technologies
          like semiconductors and quantum computers, while reshaping our philosophical understanding of reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          This field continues to challenge and expand our view of the universe.

        <h2>Core Principles</h2>
        <p>
          Quantum mechanics introduces transformative concepts. The superposition principle allows particles to exist in 
          multiple states simultaneously until measured, collapsing the wave function into a definite state. The uncertainty 
          principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927, states that certain pairs of properties—like position (x) and 
          momentum (p)—cannot be measured simultaneously with precision (ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant). 
          Entanglement links particles such that the state of one instantly affects the other, even across vast distances, a 
          phenomenon Albert Einstein famously called “spooky action at a distance.”
        </p>
        <p>
          These principles redefine how we understand particle behavior and interactions.

        <h2>Historical Development</h2>
        <p>
          Quantum mechanics arose to address failures of classical physics. Max Planck’s 1900 quantum hypothesis explained 
          blackbody radiation by proposing energy is emitted in discrete packets (quanta). In 1905, Einstein’s photoelectric 
          effect showed light behaves as particles (photons), earning him a Nobel Prize. Niels Bohr’s 1913 atomic model 
          introduced quantized electron orbits. By the 1920s, Erwin Schrödinger’s wave equation and Heisenberg’s matrix 
          mechanics formalized quantum theory, with the Copenhagen interpretation—led by Bohr—offering a probabilistic framework
          for measurement and observation.
        </p>
        <p>
          These milestones established quantum mechanics as a revolutionary science.

        <h2>Applications in Technology</h2>
        <p>
          Quantum mechanics drives modern innovation. Semiconductors, foundational to electronics like smartphones, rely on 
          quantum effects to control electron flow. Lasers exploit stimulated emission, a quantum process, for applications from
          surgery to telecommunications. Quantum computing, using qubits that leverage superposition and entanglement, promises 
          exponential speed-ups for tasks like cryptography and molecular simulation—Google’s quantum supremacy claim in 2019
          and IBM’s advancements by May 2025 highlight this potential. Quantum cryptography ensures secure communication via 
          entanglement-based protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
          These technologies illustrate quantum mechanics’ transformative impact.

        <h2>Philosophical Impact and Future Prospects</h2>
        <p>
          Quantum mechanics challenges classical notions of reality. The Copenhagen interpretation posits that observation 
          defines reality, while the many-worlds interpretation suggests each quantum event spawns parallel universes. These
          ideas spark philosophical debates about determinism and the nature of existence. Future research, as of May 2025, 
          explores quantum gravity to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity, potentially unlocking mysteries like 
          black holes. Quantum mechanics’ blend of practical utility and existential questions ensures its enduring relevance.
        </p>
        <p>
          It remains a frontier of discovery, bridging science and philosophy.
