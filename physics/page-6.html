        <h2>What Is Particle Physics?</h2>
        <p>
          Particle physics investigates the fundamental constituents of matter and the forces that govern their interactions, 
          aiming to understand the universe at its most basic level. It explores subatomic particles like quarks, leptons, and 
          bosons, and their roles in forming atoms, stars, and galaxies. This field bridges quantum mechanics and relativity, 
          offering insights into the universe’s origins and structure while driving technological advancements, from medical 
          imaging to quantum computing, as of May 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s a cornerstone of modern physics, revealing the building blocks of reality.

        <h2>Historical Development</h2>
        <p>
          Particle physics emerged in the early 20th century with J.J. Thomson’s 1897 discovery of the electron, followed by 
          Ernest Rutherford’s 1911 identification of the atomic nucleus and James Chadwick’s 1932 discovery of the neutron. The 
          advent of particle accelerators in the mid-20th century enabled deeper exploration, leading to the development of the 
          Standard Model in the 1970s. This model, validated by experiments at facilities like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), 
          classifies particles and forces, culminating in the 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson, which confirmed the mechanism 
          giving particles mass.
        </p>
        <p>
          These milestones have shaped our understanding of the subatomic world.

        <h2>Fundamental Concepts</h2>
        <p>
          The Standard Model organizes particles into quarks (e.g., up, down), leptons (e.g., electrons, neutrinos), and gauge 
          bosons (e.g., photons, gluons), which mediate forces like electromagnetism and the strong nuclear force.
          The Higgs boson, discovered in 2012, explains mass through the Higgs field. Beyond the Standard Model, phenomena like 
          dark matter—27% of the universe’s mass-energy—and the matter-antimatter asymmetry remain unexplained, prompting 
          theories such as supersymmetry and string theory to address these gaps.
        </p>
        <p>
          These concepts guide our quest to unravel cosmic mysteries.

        <h2>Applications in Technology</h2>
        <p>
          Particle physics has transformed technology. Medical imaging techniques like positron emission tomography (PET) and 
          magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rely on detecting particles from radioactive decay or magnetic fields. Particle 
          accelerators advance cancer treatment through proton therapy. The field also contributes to computing—early web 
          technologies were developed at CERN, and quantum computing research leverages particle physics principles. Cosmic ray 
          studies at observatories like IceCube and the Pierre Auger Observatory enhance our understanding of high-energy 
          particles from space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its innovations continue to impact healthcare, computing, and cosmology.

        <h2>Modern Discoveries and Future Prospects</h2>
        <p>
          Recent breakthroughs include the 2012 Higgs boson discovery, completing the Standard Model, and the 2015 detection of 
          gravitational waves by LIGO, linking particle physics to relativity. Neutrino oscillation, confirming neutrinos have 
          mass, earned a 2015 Nobel Prize. As of May 2025, research focuses on dark matter detection, with experiments
          like those at the LHC seeking new particles. Future accelerators and neutrino observatories aim to probe
          quantum gravity and the universe’s early moments, promising to deepen our cosmic understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Particle physics remains a frontier of discovery and innovation.
