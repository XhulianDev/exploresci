          Sphinx</em>, reflect spiritual beliefs, power, and human ingenuity.

          Egyptian art, with its hieroglyphs and pharaoh statues, symbolized eternity. Greek art introduced idealized forms,

          architecture. Each culture left distinct artistic legacies.

        <h2>Techniques and Materials</h2>
        <p>
          Ancient artists used stone, bronze, and clay, crafting everything from massive pyramids to delicate pottery. 
          Techniques like fresco painting and relief carving brought myths and rulers to life. Gold and pigments added vibrancy,
          as in Tutankhamun’s mask.

          These methods highlight the skill and resourcefulness of ancient creators.
