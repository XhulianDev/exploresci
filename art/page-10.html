        <h2>What is Pop Art?</h2>
        <p>
          Pop Art, emerging in the 1950s and 1960s, celebrates consumer culture with vibrant, mass-media-inspired imagery. 
          Artists like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein used comics, ads, and everyday objects, as seen in Warhol’s
          <em>Campbell’s Soup Cans</em>, to blur high and low art.
        </p>
        <p>
          This movement made art accessible and playful.

        <p>
          Born in the U.S. and UK amid post-war prosperity, Pop Art reflected the rise of advertising and pop culture. Artists 
          embraced irony, drawing from TV, magazines, and billboards. New York and London became hubs, with galleries
          showcasing its bold, rebellious spirit.

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <p>
          Pop Art uses bright colors, bold lines, and repetition, like Lichtenstein’s comic-style <em>Whaam!</em>. Techniques 
          include silkscreen printing and collage, mimicking commercial production. Themes focus on celebrities, products, and 
          irony, challenging traditional art’s seriousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          These traits define Pop Art’s cheeky, iconic style.
