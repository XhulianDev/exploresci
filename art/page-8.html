        <h2>What is Street Art?</h2>
        <p>
          Street Art transforms urban spaces with bold murals, stencils, and graffiti, often carrying social or
          political messages. 
          Artists like Banksy use public walls to provoke thought, as seen in works like <em>Balloon Girl</em>,
          blending creativity with activism.

        <h2>Evolution and Culture</h2>
        <p>
          Emerging in the 1970s with New York’s graffiti scene, Street Art grew globally, from Brazil’s colorful favelas to 
          Berlin’s East Side Gallery. It challenges traditional art spaces, embracing impermanence and accessibility. Festivals 
          like Upfest celebrate its communal spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its evolution reflects a dynamic, rebellious urban culture.

        <h2>Techniques and Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Street artists use spray paint, wheatpaste, and 3D installations, creating everything from massive murals to subtle 
          stickers. Works often address inequality, war, or identity, sparking public dialogue. Their visibility reshapes city 
          identities and inspires grassroots movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          These techniques amplify Street Art’s bold, transformative voice.
