        <h2>What is Baroque Art?</h2>
        <p>
          Baroque Art, flourishing in the 17th and early 18th centuries, is known for its dramatic intensity, rich colors, and 
          dynamic compositions. Artists like Caravaggio and Rembrandt used bold contrasts of light and shadow to evoke emotion, 
          as seen in Caravaggio’s <em>The Calling of St. Matthew</em>.

        <h2>Origins and Context</h2>
        <p>
          Emerging in Italy during the Counter-Reformation, Baroque Art was driven by the Catholic Church’s push for emotive 
          religious art. It spread across Europe, with royal courts embracing its grandeur. The era’s turbulence, including 
          wars and exploration, shaped its intense, ornate aesthetic.

          These roots reflect Baroque’s role in inspiring awe and devotion.

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <p>
          Baroque works feature dramatic lighting (chiaroscuro), swirling motion, and lavish details, as in Bernini’s
          sculptures. 
          Paintings like Rembrandt’s <em>The Night Watch</em> convey movement and emotion. Religious and mythological themes 
          dominate, often with a sense of spectacle and opulence.
        </p>
        <p>
          These traits define Baroque’s immersive, emotional power.
