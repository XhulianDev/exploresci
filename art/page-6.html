        <h2>What is Modern Art?</h2>
        <p>
          Modern Art, spanning the late 19th to mid-20th centuries, broke from tradition with experimental styles. From
          Abstract Expressionism’s raw emotion to Minimalism’s stark simplicity, artists like Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko 
          redefined 
          creativity, as seen in Pollock’s drip paintings.
        </p>
        <p>
          This era embraced innovation, challenging how art is made and perceived.

        <h2>Origins and Context</h2>
        <p>
          Modern Art emerged amid rapid industrialization, wars, and social change. Movements like Fauvism and Dadaism reacted 
          to shifting realities, with artists rejecting realism for abstraction. Galleries and avant-garde groups in Paris and 
          New York fueled its global spread.
        </p>
        <p>
          These roots highlight Modern Art’s response to a chaotic world.

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <p>
          Modern Art features diverse styles: bold colors in Matisse’s works, geometric forms in Mondrian’s grids, or emotional 
          depth in Rothko’s color fields. Techniques range from collage to splattered paint, prioritizing personal expression 
          and conceptual ideas over conventional beauty.
        </p>
        <p>
          These traits make Modern Art a dynamic, boundary-pushing force.
