          Art of the Middle Ages, spanning the 5th to 15th centuries, reflects Europe’s spiritual and feudal life. Dominated by 
          religious themes, it includes soaring Gothic cathedrals like Notre-Dame and intricate illuminated manuscripts,
          crafted by monks to glorify faith.

          Byzantine mosaics, with their golden glow, inspired awe. Romanesque churches featured robust arches and vivid
          frescoes. 
          Gothic art introduced pointed arches and stained glass, as seen in Chartres Cathedral. Manuscripts like the
          <em>Book of Kells</em> showcased delicate calligraphy.

        <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>
          Medieval art served worship and education, teaching biblical stories to the illiterate. Cathedrals were community
          hubs, while manuscripts preserved knowledge. Secular works, like tapestries, depicted chivalric tales, reflecting 
          feudal values and emerging individuality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its legacy endures in Europe’s cultural heritage.
