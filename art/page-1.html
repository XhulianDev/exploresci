        <h2>What is Renaissance Art?</h2>
        <p>
          Renaissance Art, spanning the 14th to 17th centuries, marked a cultural rebirth in Europe, reviving classical Greek 
          and Roman ideals. Emphasizing realism, perspective, and humanism, it produced iconic works like Leonardo da Vinci’s 
          <em>Mona Lisa</em> and Michelangelo’s <em>Sistine Chapel</em> frescoes. Artists explored anatomy and emotion, 
          transforming painting, sculpture, and architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          This movement reshaped artistic expression, laying the foundation for modern art and inspiring creativity across 
          centuries.

        <h2>The Roots of the Renaissance</h2>
        <p>
          The Renaissance began in Italy, fueled by wealth from trade, patronage from families like the Medici, and a renewed 
          interest in classical texts. Cities like Florence became hubs of innovation, where artists like Botticelli and 
          Raphael thrived. The invention of the printing press spread ideas, amplifying the movement’s impact across Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
          These roots highlight how economic and intellectual shifts sparked an artistic revolution.

        <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          Renaissance Art is defined by techniques like linear perspective, creating depth, and chiaroscuro, blending light 
          and shadow. Artists studied anatomy for lifelike figures, as seen in Michelangelo’s <em>David</em>. Religious themes 
          dominated, but secular subjects, like portraits and mythology, gained prominence, reflecting humanist values.
        </p>
        <p>
          These innovations made art more immersive and expressive, captivating audiences then and now.

          like <em>The Last Supper</em>. Michelangelo’s sculptures and frescoes, like the <em>Pietà</em>, showcased unparalleled 
          skill. Raphael’s harmonious compositions, such as <em>School of Athens</em>, embodied balance. Their works remain
