        <h2>What is Surrealism?</h2>
        <p>
          Surrealism, born in the 1920s, is an art movement that explores the unconscious mind, blending dreamlike scenes with 
          bizarre imagery. Led by Salvador Dalí and René Magritte, it defies logic, as seen in Dalí’s melting clocks in 
          <em>The Persistence of Memory</em>.

        <p>
          This style unlocks imagination, challenging perceptions of reality.

        <h2>Origins and Context</h2>
        <p>
          Emerging in Paris, Surrealism was influenced by Freud’s psychoanalysis and World War I’s disillusionment. Artists 
          like André Breton championed “automatic” creation to tap into subconscious thoughts. The movement spanned painting, 
          film, and literature, embracing the absurd.

          Its roots reveal a quest to transcend rational boundaries.

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <p>
          Surrealist works feature fantastical scenes, unexpected juxtapositions, and distorted forms, like Magritte’s bowler-hatted 
          men in <em>The Son of Man</em>. Vibrant or eerie tones evoke dream states. Techniques like collage and frottage added 
          unpredictability.
        </p>
        <p>
          These traits make Surrealism a portal to the uncanny.
