        <h2>What is Impressionism?</h2>
        <p>
          Impressionism, emerging in the late 19th century, revolutionized art with loose brushstrokes, vivid colors, and a 
          focus on fleeting moments. Artists like Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir captured everyday life—sunlit 
          landscapes, bustling cafés—emphasizing light and atmosphere over detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          This movement broke from tradition, celebrating spontaneity and the beauty of the present.

        <h2>Origins and Influences</h2>
        <p>
          Born in France, Impressionism grew from artists’ desire to paint outdoors, inspired by new portable paints and 
          changing social scenes. The 1860s Paris art scene, with its salons, rejected these unconventional works, leading 
          artists to form their own exhibitions. Japanese prints also shaped their bold compositions.
        </p>
        <p>
          These origins highlight Impressionism’s rebellious and innovative spirit.

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <p>
          Impressionist paintings feature bright palettes, short brushstrokes, and an emphasis on light’s effects, like Monet’s 
          shimmering water lilies. Scenes of leisure—parks, rivers, dancers—reflect modern urban life. The style prioritizes 
          impression over precision, creating a sense of movement and vibrancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          These traits make Impressionism instantly recognizable and beloved.

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>
          Impressionism paved the way for modern art, influencing movements like Post-Impressionism and Expressionism. Its 
          focus on individual perception reshaped how artists approach creativity. Today, works like Monet’s <em>Water Lilies</em> 
          draw millions to museums, proving the timeless appeal of capturing life’s fleeting beauty.
