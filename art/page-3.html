        <h2>What is Cubism?</h2>
        <p>
          Cubism, pioneered in the early 20th century by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, broke objects into geometric shapes, 
          showing multiple perspectives at once. This abstract style challenged traditional art, emphasizing form over realism, 
          as seen in Picasso’s <em>Les Demoiselles d’Avignon</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cubism redefined how we see reality, sparking modern art’s evolution.

        <h2>Origins and Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Emerging in Paris around 1907, Cubism drew from African art and Cézanne’s simplified forms. Its radical approach 
          influenced painting, sculpture, and even architecture. By breaking conventions, it inspired movements like Futurism 
          and Constructivism, reshaping 20th-century creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its bold innovation cemented Cubism’s lasting influence.

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <p>
          Cubist works use fragmented shapes, muted colors, and overlapping planes to depict objects from various angles. 
          Paintings like Braque’s <em>Violin and Candlestick</em> blend subject and background, creating a dynamic, abstract 
          experience. Collage elements, like newspaper clippings, added texture.
        </p>
        <p>
          These features make Cubism a cornerstone of abstract art.
