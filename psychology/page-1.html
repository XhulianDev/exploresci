        <h2>What is Psychology?</h2>
        <p>
          Psychology is the scientific study of behavior and mental processes, encompassing thoughts, emotions, and actions. It 
          seeks to understand why people behave the way they do, exploring both individual and group dynamics. From
          decision-making to emotional responses, psychology provides insights into the complexities of human nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a discipline, psychology bridges science and human experience, using empirical methods to uncover patterns and 
          principles that guide behavior, making it essential for improving mental health, education, and social interactions.

        <h2>History of Psychology</h2>
        <p>
          Psychology emerged as a distinct field in the late 19th century, with Wilhelm Wundt establishing the first 
          experimental psychology lab in 1879. Early approaches, like structuralism, focused on analyzing consciousness, while 
          functionalism, led by William James, explored behavior’s adaptive purposes. Later, figures like Sigmund Freud 
          introduced psychoanalysis, emphasizing the unconscious mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, psychology evolved through behaviorism, cognitive science, and humanistic perspectives, reflecting its 
          dynamic growth and adaptability to new discoveries about the mind.
