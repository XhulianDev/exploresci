        <h2>What is Learning?</h2>
        <p>
          Learning is the process through which individuals acquire new behaviors, knowledge, or skills as a result of 
          experience. In psychology, learning theories explain how these changes occur, focusing on mechanisms like
          association, reinforcement, and observation. These theories are foundational for understanding how humans and animals 
          adapt to their environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          By studying learning, psychologists develop strategies to enhance education, modify behaviors, and improve mental 
          health, making it a critical area with broad real-world impact.

        <h2>Classical Conditioning</h2>
        <p>
          Classical conditioning, discovered by Ivan Pavlov, involves learning through association. A neutral stimulus becomes 
          associated with an unconditioned stimulus that naturally triggers a response. For example, Pavlov’s dogs learned to 
          salivate (response) to a bell (neutral stimulus) after it was paired with food (unconditioned stimulus). This process 
          creates a conditioned response.
        </p>
        <p>
          Classical conditioning explains phenomena like phobias, where a neutral event becomes linked with fear, and informs 
          treatments like exposure therapy to unlearn such associations.
        </p>

        <h2>Operant Conditioning</h2>
        <p>
          Operant conditioning, developed by B.F. Skinner, focuses on learning through consequences. Behaviors followed by 
          rewards (positive reinforcement) or the removal of unpleasant stimuli (negative reinforcement) are more likely to be 
          repeated. Punishments decrease behaviors. For instance, a child may study harder if praised for good grades (positive 
          reinforcement).
        </p>
        <p>
          This theory is widely used in education, parenting, and behavior modification, shaping habits through consistent 
          consequences in various settings.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Observational Learning</h2>
        <p>
          Observational learning, highlighted by Albert Bandura’s work, occurs when individuals learn by watching others. 
          Bandura’s Bobo doll experiment showed children imitating aggressive behaviors they observed. This process involves 
          attention, retention, reproduction, and motivation. For example, a child may learn to tie shoes by watching a parent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observational learning explains social behaviors, like adopting cultural norms, and underscores the impact of role 
          models in shaping attitudes and actions.
        </p>

        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Learning theories have diverse applications:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Education:</strong> Using reinforcement to encourage student engagement.</li>
          <li><strong>Therapy:</strong> Applying classical conditioning to treat phobias.</li>
          <li><strong>Workplace:</strong> Modeling positive behaviors to train employees.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These applications demonstrate how learning theories improve teaching, mental health, and organizational
          effectiveness through evidence-based strategies.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Learning theories—classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and observational learning—provide powerful
          frameworks for understanding how we acquire behaviors and skills. By revealing the mechanisms of learning,
          they inform education, therapy, and social practices, enhancing our ability to adapt and thrive in diverse 
          environments.
