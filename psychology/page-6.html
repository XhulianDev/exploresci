        <h2>What is Memory?</h2>
        <p>
          Memory is the cognitive process that allows us to encode, store, and retrieve information, forming the basis of 
          learning, identity, and daily functioning. From recalling a friendâ€™s name to mastering a skill, memory shapes our 
          experiences. Psychologists study memory to understand how it works and why it sometimes fails, revealing insights
          into the human mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          This field is crucial for improving education, treating disorders like amnesia, and enhancing cognitive health,
          making it a cornerstone of psychological research.

        <h2>Types of Memory</h2>
        <p>
          Memory is categorized into several types: Sensory memory holds fleeting impressions, like a glimpse of a scene, for 
          milliseconds. Short-term memory, or working memory, stores information temporarily, such as a phone number, for about 
          20-30 seconds. Long-term memory, which includes explicit (facts, events) and implicit (skills, habits) memory, can 
          last a lifetime, like remembering your childhood home.
        </p>
        <p>
          These distinctions help explain how we process and retain diverse information, from fleeting sensations to enduring 
          knowledge.
        </p>

        <h2>The Process of Memory</h2>
        <p>
          Memory involves three stages: encoding, storage, and retrieval. Encoding transforms sensory input into a form the 
          brain can process, like associating a smell with an event. Storage maintains this information, with stronger
          emotional or repeated experiences often stored more durably. Retrieval accesses stored information, though cues, like 
          a song triggering a memory, can aid or hinder this process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding these stages informs strategies to improve recall, such as mnemonic devices used in studying or therapy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why We Forget</h2>
        <p>
          Forgetting occurs due to factors like decay (fading of unused memories), interference (new or old memories disrupting 
          recall), or retrieval failure (inability to access stored information). For example, proactive interference happens 
          when old information, like an outdated phone number, hinders learning a new one. The Ebbinghaus forgetting curve
          shows that memory retention drops rapidly without review.
        </p>
        <p>
          These insights explain memory lapses and guide techniques to enhance retention, like spaced repetition in learning.
        </p>

        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Memory research has wide applications:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Education:</strong> Designing study techniques to boost retention, like flashcards.</li>
          <li><strong>Therapy:</strong> Helping patients with trauma recall or reframe memories.</li>
          <li><strong>Law:</strong> Understanding eyewitness memory reliability in court cases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These applications improve learning, mental health, and justice by leveraging how memory functions and fails.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Memory and forgetting are central to how we learn, interact, and define ourselves, with complex processes of
          encoding, storage, and retrieval. By exploring types of memory and reasons for forgetting, psychologists enhance 
          education, therapy, and more, offering tools to strengthen cognitive abilities and address memory challenges 
          effectively.
