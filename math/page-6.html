        <h2>Introduction to Geometry</h2>
        <p>
          Geometry is the branch of mathematics that studies shapes, sizes, and the properties of space. From designing 
          buildings to understanding the universe, geometry provides the tools to describe and analyze the physical world. At 
          its core, geometry begins with fundamental concepts like points, lines, and angles, which form the building blocks
          for more complex shapes and structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Geometry is not only theoretical but also highly practical, appearing in fields like architecture, engineering, art, 
          and even computer graphics. By mastering the basics, you gain the ability to solve problems involving measurements, 
          spatial relationships, and design.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Points, Lines, and Planes</h2>
        <p>
          The foundation of geometry lies in three undefined terms: points, lines, and planes. A point represents a precise 
          location in space, with no size or dimension, often denoted by a dot and a letter (e.g., point A). A line is a 
          straight, infinite path of points extending in both directions, defined by two points (e.g., line AB). A plane is a 
          flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely, like a sheet of paper with no thickness.
        </p>
        <p>
          These elements interact to form geometric figures. For example, two lines in a plane may intersect at a point or 
          remain parallel, never meeting. Understanding these relationships is crucial for constructing and analyzing shapes.
        </p>

        <h2>Angles and Their Properties</h2>
        <p>
          An angle is formed when two rays (line segments with a common endpoint) meet at a point called the vertex.
          Angles are measured in degrees, with a full circle equaling 360°. Common types include acute angles (less than 90°), 
          right angles (exactly 90°), obtuse angles (more than 90° but less than 180°), and straight angles (180°).
        </p>
        <p>
          Angles are essential for defining shapes and solving problems. For instance, the sum of angles in a triangle is
          always 180°, a property used in construction and design to ensure stability and alignment.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Shapes: Triangles, Quadrilaterals, and Circles</h2>
        <p>
          Geometric shapes are defined by their sides and angles. Triangles, with three sides and three angles, can be 
          classified as equilateral (all sides equal), isosceles (two sides equal), or scalene (no sides equal).
          Quadrilaterals, like squares, rectangles, and trapezoids, have four sides and vary in properties, such as parallel 
          sides or equal lengths. Circles, defined by a center and radius, are unique for their symmetry and constant 
          circumference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each shape has specific properties that make it useful in real-world applications, from building stable structures 
          (triangles) to designing wheels (circles).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Perimeter, Area, and Volume</h2>
        <p>
          Geometry involves calculating measurements of shapes. Perimeter is the total distance around a two-dimensional shape, 
          such as \( P = 4s \) for a square with side length \( s \). Area measures the space inside a shape, like \( A = l 
          \cdot w \) for a rectangle or \( A = \pi r^2 \) for a circle. Volume, for three-dimensional shapes, measures space 
          occupied, such as \( V = l \cdot w \cdot h \) for a rectangular prism or \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \) for a sphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          These formulas are vital for practical tasks, like determining the amount of paint needed for a wall (area) or
          the capacity of a container (volume).
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Geometry is everywhere in daily life:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Using triangles for stable roof designs.</li>
          <li><strong>Art:</strong> Applying angles and symmetry in drawings or sculptures.</li>
          <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Calculating the volume of materials for a bridge.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Whether measuring land, designing furniture, or creating video game graphics, geometry provides the framework for 
          precision and creativity.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Geometry basics lay the groundwork for understanding shapes, spaces, and their measurements. By grasping points,
          lines, angles, shapes, and formulas, you unlock the ability to solve practical problems and explore advanced 
          mathematical concepts. Geometry not only sharpens analytical skills but also connects mathematics to the world around 
          us.
