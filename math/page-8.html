        <h2>Introduction to Trigonometry</h2>
        <p>
          Trigonometry is the study of relationships between angles and sides of triangles, particularly right triangles. It 
          originated from the need to measure distances and angles in fields like astronomy, navigation, and surveying. By 
          understanding trigonometric ratios, we can solve problems involving heights, distances, and periodic phenomena like 
          waves or orbits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trigonometry is not just theoretical; it’s a practical tool used in engineering, physics, architecture, and even 
          computer graphics, making it essential for anyone exploring mathematics or applied sciences.

        <h2>Trigonometric Ratios: Sine, Cosine, and Tangent</h2>
        <p>
          In a right triangle, the three primary trigonometric ratios—sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan)—describe 
          relationships between an angle and the triangle’s sides. For an angle θ, these ratios are defined using the sides: 
          opposite (opposite the angle), adjacent (next to the angle), and hypotenuse (the longest side).
        </p>
        <p>
          The formulas are:
          \[ \sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}, \quad \cos(\theta) = 
          \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}, \quad \tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} \]
          These ratios allow us to calculate unknown sides or angles when some measurements are known.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Right Triangle Trigonometry</h2>
        <p>
          Right triangle trigonometry applies these ratios to solve for unknown sides or angles. For example, if a right 
          triangle has an angle of 30° and a hypotenuse of 10 units, we can find the opposite side using \( \sin(30°) = 
          \frac{\text{opposite}}{10} \). Since \( \sin(30°) = 0.5 \), the opposite side is \( 0.5 \cdot 10 = 5 \) units.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, cosine or tangent can be used depending on the known sides. This method is powerful for problems like 
          finding the height of a building or the angle of a ramp, where direct measurement is difficult.
        </p>

        <h2>Applications in Problem-Solving</h2>
        <p>
          Trigonometry has wide-ranging applications:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Determining a ship’s direction using angles from a known point.</li>
          <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Calculating the slope of a roof to ensure proper drainage.</li>
          <li><strong>Astronomy:</strong> Measuring distances to stars using angular observations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These applications rely on the precision of trigonometric ratios, making them indispensable for accurate calculations 
          in real-world scenarios.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Trigonometry fundamentals provide a gateway to understanding angles and their relationships with triangle sides. By 
          mastering sine, cosine, and tangent ratios, you can solve practical problems and lay the foundation for advanced 
          topics like periodic functions and calculus. Trigonometry connects mathematics to the physical world, enhancing 
          problem-solving skills across disciplines.
