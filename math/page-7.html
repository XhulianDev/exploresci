        <h2>Introduction to Coordinate Geometry</h2>
        <p>
          Coordinate geometry, also known as analytic geometry, bridges algebra and geometry by representing points, lines, and 
          shapes on a coordinate plane. Using numerical coordinates, it allows precise calculations of distances, slopes, and 
          equations, making it a powerful tool for solving geometric problems. This field is essential in fields like physics, 
          computer graphics, and engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          By assigning coordinates to geometric objects, coordinate geometry transforms abstract shapes into algebraic
          equations, enabling us to analyze their properties with mathematical precision.

        <h2>The Cartesian Plane</h2>
        <p>
          The Cartesian plane is a two-dimensional grid formed by two perpendicular number lines: the x-axis (horizontal) and 
          the y-axis (vertical), intersecting at the origin (0,0). Each point on the plane is represented by an ordered
          pair (x, y), where x is the horizontal distance and y is the vertical distance from the origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The plane is divided into four quadrants, numbered counterclockwise. For example, (3, 2) lies in Quadrant I,
          while (-1, -4) is in Quadrant III. This system provides a framework for plotting points and analyzing geometric 
          relationships.
        </p>

        <h2>Distance Between Two Points</h2>
        <p>
          The distance between two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is calculated using the distance formula, 
          derived from the Pythagorean theorem: 
          \[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \]
          For example, the distance between (1, 2) and (4, 6) is \( \sqrt{(4-1)^2 + (6-2)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \).
        </p>
        <p>
          This formula is crucial for measuring lengths in applications like navigation, map-making, and computer-aided design, 
          where precise distances are needed.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Midpoint Formula</h2>
        <p>
          The midpoint of a line segment connecting two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is found using the
          midpoint formula:
          \[ \text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right) \]
          For example, the midpoint of (1, 3) and (5, 7) is \( \left( \frac{1+5}{2}, \frac{3+7}{2} \right) = (3, 5) \).
        </p>
        <p>
          The midpoint formula is used in design and engineering to find central points, such as the center of a bridge span or 
          the balance point of a structure.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Slope of a Line</h2>
        <p>
          The slope of a line measures its steepness, calculated as the ratio of the vertical change (rise) to the horizontal 
          change (run) between two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \):
          \[ \text{Slope} = m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]
          For example, the slope between (2, 3) and (4, 7) is \( \frac{7-3}{4-2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).
        </p>
        <p>
          Slope indicates whether a line is rising (positive), falling (negative), horizontal (zero), or vertical (undefined). 
          Itâ€™s vital for understanding linear relationships in fields like physics and economics.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Equations of Lines</h2>
        <p>
          Lines in the Cartesian plane are represented by equations. The slope-intercept form, \( y = mx + b \), uses the
          slope \( m \) and y-intercept \( b \). For example, \( y = 2x + 1 \) has a slope of 2 and crosses the y-axis at
          (0, 1). Another form, the point-slope form, is \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \), useful for writing equations given a
          point and slope.
        </p>
        <p>
          These equations model linear relationships, such as predicting costs or analyzing motion, and are foundational for 
          graphing and solving systems of equations.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Coordinate geometry is used in numerous fields:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Calculating the distance between two GPS coordinates.</li>

        <p>
          From designing roads to programming video games, coordinate geometry provides the mathematical precision needed for 
          accurate results.
