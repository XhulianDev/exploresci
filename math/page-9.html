        <h2>Introduction to Probability and Statistics</h2>
        <p>
          Probability and statistics are mathematical disciplines that help us understand uncertainty and analyze data. 
          Probability predicts the likelihood of events, while statistics organizes and interprets numerical information. 
          Together, they are essential for making informed decisions in fields like science, business, medicine, and sports.
        </p>
        <p>
          From forecasting weather to evaluating survey results, these tools allow us to quantify chance and draw meaningful 
          conclusions from data, making them vital for both academic study and everyday life.
        </p>

        <h2>Basic Probability Rules</h2>
        <p>
          Probability measures the chance of an event occurring, expressed as a number between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain). 
          For example, the probability of rolling a 3 on a six-sided die is \( \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.167 \). Key rules include 
          the addition rule for mutually exclusive events (\( P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) \)) and the multiplication rule 
          for independent events (\( P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \)).
        </p>
        <p>
          These rules help solve problems like calculating the chance of drawing two aces from a deck or predicting outcomes in 
          games and experiments.
        </p>

        <h2>Measures of Central Tendency</h2>
        <p>
          Statistics uses measures like mean, median, and mode to summarize data. The mean (average) is found by adding all 
          values and dividing by the number of values, e.g., the mean of 2, 4, 6 is \( \frac{2+4+6}{3} = 4 \).
          The median is the middle value when data is ordered, and the mode is the most frequent value.
        </p>
        <p>
          These measures provide insights into data trends. For example, the mean score of a class test indicates overall 
          performance, while the median highlights the central tendency unaffected by extreme values.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Data Interpretation with Graphs</h2>
        <p>
          Graphs and charts, such as bar graphs, pie charts, and histograms, visually represent data for easier interpretation. 
          A bar graph compares categories, a pie chart shows proportions, and a histogram displays the distribution of
          numerical data. For instance, a histogram of test scores can reveal whether most students scored high or low.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding these visuals is crucial for analyzing trends, like tracking sales over time or comparing population 
          statistics, making data accessible to diverse audiences.
        </p>

        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Probability and statistics are applied in many areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Medicine:</strong> Assessing the probability of treatment success based on clinical trials.</li>
          <li><strong>Business:</strong> Using mean sales data to forecast profits.</li>
          <li><strong>Sports:</strong> Analyzing player statistics to strategize game plans.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These tools empower decision-making by providing clarity in uncertain or data-heavy situations.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Probability and statistics equip us to navigate uncertainty and interpret data effectively. By understanding 
          probability rules, central measures, and data visualization, you can make sense of complex information and
          apply it to real-world challenges. These skills are invaluable for critical thinking and problem-solving across 
          disciplines.
