        <h2>Introduction to Polynomials</h2>
        <p>
          Polynomials are algebraic expressions made up of variables and constants, combined using addition, subtraction, and 
          multiplication, with non-negative integer exponents. Examples include \( 3x^2 + 2x - 5 \) or \( x^4 - 1 \). They are 
          fundamental in algebra, modeling relationships in fields like physics, economics, and computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding polynomials and their manipulation is crucial for solving equations, analyzing functions, and 
          simplifying complex mathematical problems, making them a cornerstone of advanced mathematics.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>Operations with Polynomials</h2>
        <p>
          Polynomials can be added, subtracted, or multiplied. To add or subtract, combine like terms (terms with the same 
          variable and exponent), e.g., \( (2x^2 + 3x) + (x^2 - 2x) = 3x^2 + x \). For multiplication, distribute each term,
          e.g., \( (x + 2)(x + 3) = x^2 + 5x + 6 \), using the distributive property or FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last).
        </p>
        <p>
          These operations are essential for simplifying expressions and solving equations, often used in modeling scenarios 
          like cost functions or motion trajectories.
        </p>

        <h2>Factoring Polynomials</h2>
        <p>
          Factoring breaks a polynomial into simpler factors that, when multiplied, give the original expression. Common 
          techniques include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Greatest Common Factor (GCF):</strong> Factor out the largest common factor, e.g.,
          \( 4x^2 + 8x = 4x(x + 2) \).</li>
          <li><strong>Difference of Squares:</strong> For \( x^2 - a^2 \), factor as \( (x - a)(x + a) \), e.g.,
          \( x^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3) \).</li>
          <li><strong>Trinomials:</strong> For \( ax^2 + bx + c \), find factors of \( a \cdot c \) that add to
          \( b \), e.g., \( x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3) \).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Factoring simplifies expressions and is key for solving polynomial equations, like finding the roots of
          \( x^2 - 4 = 0 \).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Solving Polynomial Equations</h2>
        <p>
          Factoring is often used to solve polynomial equations by setting each factor to zero. For example, to solve
          \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \), factor as \( (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0 \), giving solutions \( x = 2 \) or \( x = 3 \).
          This method, known as the zero-product property, is critical for finding roots of polynomials.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solving these equations helps in applications like determining break-even points in business or intersection points
          in geometric designs.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Polynomials and factoring are applied in various contexts:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Modeling the trajectory of a projectile with a quadratic polynomial.</li>
          <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Using polynomials to calculate compound interest growth.</li>
          <li><strong>Computer Science:</strong> Simplifying algorithms through polynomial factorization.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These applications demonstrate the versatility of polynomials in solving real-world problems with precision.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Polynomials and factoring form a vital part of algebra, offering tools to simplify expressions, solve equations, and 
          model complex scenarios. By mastering these techniques, you build a foundation for advanced mathematics and practical 
          problem-solving, applicable in science, technology, and beyond.
