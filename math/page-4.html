        <h2>Introduction to Functions</h2>
        <p>
          A function is a mathematical relationship where each input has exactly one output. Functions are central to algebra, 
          modeling real-world scenarios like motion, growth, or costs. Graphs visually represent functions, making it easier to 
          understand their behavior.

        <h2>Domain and Range</h2>
        <p>
          The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (x), while the range is the set of all possible 
          output values (y). For example, in \( y = x^2 \), the domain is all real numbers, but the range is \( y \geq 0 \), as 
          the output is never negative.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Types of Functions</h2>
        <p>
          Common functions include linear, quadratic, and exponential, each with distinct graphs and applications.
        </p>
        <h3>Linear Functions</h3>
        <p>
          Linear functions, like \( y = mx + b \), produce straight-line graphs. Here, \( m \) is the slope (steepness),
          and \( b \) is the y-intercept. For example, \( y = 2x + 3 \) has a slope of 2 and crosses the y-axis at 3.
        </p>
        <h3>Quadratic Functions</h3>
        <p>
          Quadratic functions, like \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), form parabolas. For example, \( y = x^2 \) opens upward with a 
          vertex at (0,0). They model projectile motion or profit curves.
        </p>
        <h3>Exponential Functions</h3>
        <p>
          Exponential functions, like \( y = a^x \), show rapid growth or decay. For example, \( y = 2^x \) doubles with each 
          unit increase in \( x \), used in population growth or interest calculations.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Plotting and Interpreting Graphs</h2>
        <p>
          To plot a function, select input values (x), compute outputs (y), and plot points (x, y) on a coordinate plane. 
          Connecting these points reveals the graphâ€™s shape. Key features to interpret include intercepts, slope, vertex, or 
          asymptotes. For example, the graph of \( y = x + 1 \) crosses the y-axis at (0,1) and has a slope of 1.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Practical Examples</h2>
        <p>
          Functions and graphs are used in various contexts:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Linear:</strong> Calculating distance traveled at a constant speed: \( d = 60t \),
          where \( t \) is time.</li>
          <li><strong>Quadratic:</strong> Modeling the height of a thrown ball: \( h = -16t^2 + 32t \).</li>
          <li><strong>Exponential:</strong> Estimating compound interest: \( A = P(1 + r)^t \).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Role in Higher Mathematics</h2>
        <p>
          Functions are foundational for calculus, trigonometry, and data analysis. Graphs help visualize trends in statistics, 
          physics, and economics, making functions essential for advanced studies.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Functions and graphs provide a powerful way to model and analyze relationships in mathematics and the real world. 
          Understanding their properties and visual representations equips you with tools for problem-solving and critical 
          thinking across disciplines.
