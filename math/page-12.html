        <h2>Introduction to Sequences and Series</h2>
        <p>
          Sequences and series are ordered lists of numbers following specific patterns, fundamental to understanding 
          mathematical structures and real-world phenomena. A sequence is a list of terms, like 2, 4, 6, ..., while a series is 
          the sum of those terms, like 2 + 4 + 6. Patterns help identify rules governing these sequences, enabling predictions 
          and applications in fields like finance, computer science, and physics.
        </p>
        <p>
          By studying sequences, series, and patterns, you develop skills to recognize trends, make forecasts, and solve 
          problems involving ordered data, enhancing analytical thinking.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Arithmetic Sequences</h2>
        <p>
          An arithmetic sequence has a constant difference between consecutive terms, called the common difference.
          For example, in 3, 7, 11, 15, ..., the common difference is 4.
          The \( n \)-th term is given by \( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \), where \( a_1 \) is the first term and \( d \) is the common 
          difference. For the sequence above, \( a_n = 3 + (n-1) \cdot 4 \).
        </p>
        <p>
          Arithmetic sequences model linear growth, such as savings with fixed monthly deposits or evenly spaced fence posts, 
          making them practical for planning and design.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Geometric Sequences</h2>
        <p>
          A geometric sequence has a constant ratio between consecutive terms, called the common ratio.
          For example, in 2, 6, 18, 54, ..., the common ratio is 3. The \( n \)-th term is \( a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1} \),
          where \( a_1 \) is the first term and \( r \) is the common ratio. For the sequence above,
          \( a_n = 2 \cdot 3^{n-1} \).
        </p>
        <p>
          Geometric sequences describe exponential growth or decay, like compound interest or population changes, and
          are crucial in financial and scientific modeling.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Series and Summation Notation</h2>
        <p>
          A series is the sum of a sequenceâ€™s terms.
          For an arithmetic series, the sum of the first \( n \) terms is \( S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n) \), where \( a_n \) 
          is the \( n \)-th term. For a geometric series, the sum is \( S_n = a_1 \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \)
          (for \( r \neq 1 \)). Summation notation, using the sigma symbol \( \Sigma \), compactly represents series, e.g.,
          \( \sum_{k=1}^n k \) for the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Series are used to calculate totals, like accumulated savings or the total distance of a bouncing ball, providing 
          powerful tools for quantitative analysis.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Recognizing and Describing Patterns</h2>
        <p>
          Patterns are rules or relationships governing sequences. Recognizing them involves identifying differences, ratios,
          or recursive rules. For example, the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...) follows a pattern where each term is
          the sum of the two preceding ones. Describing patterns mathematically allows predictions, like finding the 10th term 
          of a sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pattern recognition is vital in coding algorithms, designing structures, and analyzing data trends, bridging 
          mathematics with practical applications.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Sequences, series, and patterns are applied in various fields:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Calculating total returns using geometric series for compound interest.</li>
          <li><strong>Computer Science:</strong> Using sequences in algorithms for data processing.</li>
          <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Designing structures with repeating patterns for stability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These concepts enable precise modeling of growth, repetition, and trends in real-world scenarios.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Sequences, series, and patterns reveal the order and predictability in mathematics, offering tools to model and 
          analyze trends. By understanding arithmetic and geometric sequences, summation, and pattern recognition, you can
          solve complex problems and apply these concepts to diverse fields, fostering logical and creative thinking.
