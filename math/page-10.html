        <h2>Introduction to Systems of Equations and Inequalities</h2>
        <p>
          A system of equations or inequalities involves multiple equations or inequalities that share common variables, solved 
          simultaneously to find values that satisfy all conditions. These systems model real-world situations, such as 
          optimizing resources or analyzing intersecting paths, and are fundamental in algebra, economics, and engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          By learning to solve these systems, you gain tools to tackle complex problems where multiple constraints or 
          relationships must be considered together, enhancing analytical skills.

        <h2>Systems of Linear Equations</h2>
        <p>
          A system of linear equations consists of two or more linear equations, like \( 2x + y = 5 \) and \( x - y = 1 \). The 
          solution is the point (x, y) that satisfies all equations, often representing the intersection of their graphs. 
          Solutions can be unique (one point), infinite (coinciding lines), or nonexistent (parallel lines).
        </p>
        <p>
          These systems are used in scenarios like determining quantities in mixtures or finding break-even points in business, 
          where multiple linear relationships must align.
        </p>

        <h2>Solving Systems Algebraically</h2>
        <p>
          Two common algebraic methods are substitution and elimination. In substitution, solve one equation for a variable and 
          substitute into the other, e.g., for \( y = 5 - 2x \) and \( x - y = 1 \), substitute to get \( x - (5 - 2x) = 1 \), 
          yielding \( x = 2 \), then \( y = 1 \). In elimination, add or subtract equations to eliminate a variable, e.g., 
          adding \( 2x + y = 5 \) and \( x - y = 1 \) gives \( 3x = 6 \), so \( x = 2 \).
        </p>
        <p>
          These methods provide precise solutions, ideal for problems requiring exact values, such as calculating production 
          quantities or financial balances.
        </p>

        <h2>Solving Systems Graphically</h2>
        <p>
          Graphically, a system of equations is solved by plotting each equation on a coordinate plane and finding their 
          intersection. For \( 2x + y = 5 \) and \( x - y = 1 \), the lines intersect at (2, 1), the solution. This method is 
          intuitive for visualizing relationships but less precise for non-integer solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Graphical solutions are useful in fields like physics or logistics, where visualizing intersecting paths or 
          constraints helps understand the problem.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Systems of Inequalities</h2>
        <p>
          A system of inequalities, like \( y > x + 1 \) and \( y \leq 2x - 1 \), describes a region where all inequalities are 
          true. Graph each inequality by shading the region that satisfies it; the solution is the overlapping shaded area. For 
          example, the system above defines a region bounded by the lines \( y = x + 1 \) and \( y = 2x - 1 \).
        </p>
        <p>
          These systems model constraints, such as budgeting limits or production capacities, where solutions lie within a 
          feasible region rather than at a single point.
        </p>

        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Systems of equations and inequalities are applied in various contexts:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Business:</strong> Finding the optimal mix of products to maximize profit.</li>
          <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Balancing forces in structural designs.</li>
          <li><strong>Logistics:</strong> Determining delivery routes with time and distance constraints.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These applications highlight the power of systems to solve multifaceted problems efficiently.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Systems of equations and inequalities provide robust methods for solving problems with multiple conditions. By 
          mastering algebraic and graphical techniques, you can address real-world challenges with precision, from optimizing 
          resources to analyzing relationships. These skills are essential for advanced mathematics and practical
          decision-making.
