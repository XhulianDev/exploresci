        <h2>Introduction to Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages</h2>
        <p>
          Fractions, decimals, and percentages are different ways to represent parts of a whole. These mathematical concepts
          are fundamental for understanding proportions, ratios, and real-world applications like budgeting, measurements, and 
          data analysis. Mastering their relationships and operations is key to building a strong foundation in mathematics.

        <h2>Understanding Fractions</h2>
        <p>
          A fraction represents a part of a whole, expressed as a ratio of two numbers: the numerator (top) and the denominator 
          (bottom). For example, in the fraction 3/4, 3 is the numerator, and 4 is the denominator, indicating three parts out 
          of four equal parts. Fractions can be proper (numerator &lt; denominator), improper (numerator &ge; denominator),
          or mixed (a whole number combined with a fraction).
        </p>
        <p>
          Simplifying fractions involves dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD) to 
          express the fraction in its lowest terms. For example, 6/8 simplifies to 3/4 by dividing both by 2.
        </p>

        <h2>Decimals and Their Role</h2>
        <p>
          Decimals represent fractions using a base-10 system, with digits after a decimal point indicating parts of a whole. 
          For example, 0.75 represents 75 hundredths, equivalent to the fraction 75/100 or 3/4. Decimals are widely used in 
          measurements, finance, and scientific calculations due to their precision and ease of use in computations.
        </p>

        <h2>Percentages: A Special Case</h2>
        <p>
          Percentages express numbers as parts per hundred, denoted by the % symbol. For instance, 50% means 50 out of 100, 
          equivalent to the fraction 1/2 or the decimal 0.5. Percentages are commonly used in everyday life, such as
          calculating discounts, taxes, or statistical data.

        <h2>Converting Between Formats</h2>
        <p>
          Converting between fractions, decimals, and percentages is a critical skill. Here’s how to do it:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fraction to Decimal:</strong> Divide the numerator by the denominator.
          For example, 3/4 = 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75.</li>
          <li><strong>Decimal to Fraction:</strong> Express the decimal as a fraction with a power of 10, then simplify.
          For example, 0.6 = 6/10 = 3/5.</li>
          <li><strong>Fraction to Percentage:</strong> Convert the fraction to a decimal, then multiply by 100.
          For example, 1/2 = 0.5 = 50%.</li>
          <li><strong>Percentage to Decimal:</strong> Divide by 100. For example, 75% = 75 ÷ 100 = 0.75.</li>
          <li><strong>Decimal to Percentage:</strong> Multiply by 100. For example, 0.25 = 0.25 × 100 = 25%.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Operations with Fractions and Decimals</h2>
        <p>
          Performing operations with fractions and decimals requires specific techniques:
        </p>
        <h3>Fractions</h3>
        <p>
          - <strong>Addition/Subtraction:</strong> Ensure a common denominator, then add or subtract the numerators.
          For example, 1/3 + 1/6 = 2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2.<br>
          - <strong>Multiplication:</strong> Multiply numerators and denominators directly, then simplify.
          For example, 2/3 × 3/4 = 6/12 = 1/2.<br>
          - <strong>Division:</strong> Multiply by the reciprocal of the second fraction.
          For example, 2/3 ÷ 1/2 = 2/3 × 2/1 = 4/3.
        </p>
        <h3>Decimals</h3>
        <p>
          - <strong>Addition/Subtraction:</strong> Align decimal points and add or subtract as with whole numbers.
          For example, 1.23 + 0.56 = 1.79.<br>
          - <strong>Multiplication:</strong> Multiply as whole numbers, then adjust the decimal point based on the
          total decimal places. For example, 0.2 × 0.3 = 0.06.<br>
          - <strong>Division:</strong> Move decimal points to make the divisor a whole number, then divide.
          For example, 0.6 ÷ 0.2 = 6 ÷ 2 = 3.
        </p>

        <h2>Practical Examples</h2>
        <p>
          These concepts are applied in many real-world scenarios:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fractions:</strong> Dividing a recipe in half, e.g., using 1/2 cup of flour instead of 1 cup.</li>
          <li><strong>Decimals:</strong> Calculating the exact cost of items, e.g., $19.99 + $3.50.</li>
          <li><strong>Percentages:</strong> Determining a 20% discount on a $50 item, resulting in a $10 savings.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Role in Higher Mathematics</h2>
        <p>
          Fractions, decimals, and percentages are foundational for advanced topics like algebra, probability, and calculus. 
          They appear in rational expressions, statistical analysis, and financial mathematics, making their mastery essential 
          for academic and professional success.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Fractions, decimals, and percentages are versatile tools for representing and manipulating parts of a whole.
          By understanding how to convert between them and perform operations, you gain the ability to solve practical problems 
          and prepare for more complex mathematical challenges. These skills are not only critical for mathematics but also for 
          logical thinking and decision-making in everyday life.
