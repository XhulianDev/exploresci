        <h2>Introduction to Ratios, Proportions, and Rates</h2>
        <p>
          Ratios, proportions, and rates are mathematical tools used to compare quantities and solve problems in everyday life. 
          From cooking recipes to calculating speeds, these concepts help us understand relationships between numbers and make 
          informed decisions.

        <h2>What is a Ratio?</h2>
        <p>
          A ratio compares two quantities, showing how many times one is contained in the other. It can be written as a
          fraction (e.g., 3/2), with a colon (3:2), or as "3 to 2." For example, if a recipe uses 3 cups of flour and 2 cups of 
          sugar, the ratio of flour to sugar is 3:2.

        <h2>Proportions: Equal Ratios</h2>
        <p>
          A proportion is an equation stating that two ratios are equal, such as \( \frac{3}{4} = \frac{6}{8} \).
          To solve a proportion, cross-multiply: for \( \frac{x}{5} = \frac{4}{10} \), multiply \( x \cdot 10 = 4 \cdot 5 \),
          so \( 10x = 20 \), and \( x = 2 \). Proportions are used to scale quantities, like adjusting a recipe for more 
          servings.

        <h2>Rates: Ratios with Units</h2>
        <p>
          A rate is a special ratio comparing quantities with different units, such as miles per hour or dollars per kilogram. 
          For example, driving 120 miles in 2 hours gives a rate of 60 miles per hour. Unit rates, where the denominator is 1, 
          simplify comparisons, like $2 per liter.
        </p>

        <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
        <p>
          These concepts are widely used:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ratio:</strong> Mixing paint with a 2:1 ratio of blue to white.</li>
          <li><strong>Proportion:</strong> Scaling a map where 1 cm represents 10 km.</li>
          <li><strong>Rate:</strong> Calculating fuel efficiency as 30 miles per gallon.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Ratios, proportions, and rates simplify comparisons and problem-solving in mathematics and daily life. By mastering 
          these tools, you can tackle practical challenges like budgeting, scaling, or measuring efficiency with confidence.
