        <h2>Introduction to Algebraic Expressions and Equations</h2>
        <p>
          Algebraic expressions and equations are the cornerstone of algebra, enabling us to represent and solve real-world 
          problems using variables and mathematical operations. An algebraic expression is a combination of numbers, variables, 
          and operations, while an equation sets two expressions equal to each other. Mastering these concepts is essential for 
          advancing in mathematics and applying algebra to practical scenarios.
        </p>

        <h2>Understanding Algebraic Expressions</h2>
        <p>
          An algebraic expression consists of constants, variables (e.g., \(x\), \(y\)), and operations (addition, subtraction, 
          multiplication, division, exponents). For example, \(3x + 5\) is an expression where 3 is a coefficient, \(x\) is a 
          variable, and 5 is a constant. Expressions can be simplified by combining like terms (terms with the same variable
          and exponent), such as simplifying \(2x + 3x + 4\) to \(5x + 4\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Expressions are used to model relationships, such as the cost of \(x\) items at $3 each plus a $5 fee, represented
          as \(3x + 5\).
        </p>

        <h2>Solving Linear Equations</h2>
        <p>
          A linear equation is an equation where the highest power of the variable is 1, such as \(2x + 3 = 7\). Solving a 
          linear equation involves finding the value of the variable that makes the equation true. The goal is to isolate the 
          variable using inverse operations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Addition/Subtraction:</strong> To undo addition, subtract, and vice versa. For example,
          in \(x + 5 = 10\), subtract 5 from both sides to get \(x = 5\).</li>
          <li><strong>Multiplication/Division:</strong> To undo multiplication, divide, and vice versa. For example,
          in \(3x = 12\), divide both sides by 3 to get \(x = 4\).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For multi-step equations like \(2x + 3 = 11\), first subtract 3 (\(2x = 8\)), then divide by 2 (\(x = 4\)).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Solving Linear Inequalities</h2>
        <p>
          Linear inequalities, such as \(2x + 1 &lt; 5\), are similar to equations but describe a range of solutions.
          Solving them follows the same steps as equations, with one key rule: when multiplying or dividing both sides by a 
          negative number, reverse the inequality sign. For example, to solve \(-x &gt; 3\), divide by \(-1\) and reverse the 
          sign to get \(x &lt; -3\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Inequalities are useful for describing constraints, such as budgets or ranges of possible values.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Introduction to Factoring</h2>
        <p>
          Factoring is the process of breaking down an algebraic expression into simpler components (factors) that, when 
          multiplied, give the original expression. Common factoring techniques include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Greatest Common Factor (GCF):</strong> Factor out the largest common factor, e.g.,
          \(6x + 9 = 3(2x + 3)\).</li>
          <li><strong>Difference of Squares:</strong> For expressions like \(x^2 - 4\), factor as \((x - 2)(x + 2)\).</li>
          <li><strong>Trinomials:</strong> For \(x^2 + 5x + 6\), find factors of 6 that add to 5,
          resulting in \((x + 2)(x + 3)\).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Factoring is essential for simplifying expressions and solving equations like \(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Practical Examples</h2>
        <p>
          Algebraic expressions and equations have wide applications:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Expressions:</strong> Calculating the total cost of \(x\) tickets at $10 each plus a $5 fee:
          \(10x + 5\).</li>
          <li><strong>Equations:</strong> Determining how many hours (\(x\)) it takes to save $100 at $20 per hour:
          \(20x = 100\), so \(x = 5\).</li>
          <li><strong>Inequalities:</strong> Finding the number of items (\(x\)) you can buy with $50 if each costs $15:
          \(15x \leq 50\), so \(x \leq 3.33\), meaning up to 3 items.</li>
          <li><strong>Factoring:</strong> Solving \(x^2 - 9 = 0\) by factoring as \((x - 3)(x + 3) = 0\),
          giving \(x = 3\) or \(x = -3\).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Role in Higher Mathematics</h2>
        <p>
          Algebraic expressions and equations are foundational for advanced topics like quadratic equations, functions, and 
          calculus. Factoring techniques are critical in polynomial equations and rational expressions, while linear equations 
          and inequalities underpin systems of equations and optimization problems in fields like engineering and economics.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Algebraic expressions and equations unlock the power of algebra, allowing us to model and solve complex problems with 
          precision. By mastering simplification, equation-solving, and factoring, you build a strong foundation for 
          mathematical exploration and real-world applications. These skills foster analytical thinking and problem-solving, 
          essential for academic success and beyond.
