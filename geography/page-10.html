        <h2>What Is Mount Everest?</h2>
        <p>
          Mount Everest, straddling Nepal and Tibet in the Mahalangur Himal range, stands as the world’s highest peak at 8,848 
          meters (29,029 feet). Its majestic snow-capped summit, jagged ridges, and glaciers inspire awe, drawing adventurers, 
          researchers, and cultural enthusiasts to its formidable slopes as of May 2025.

        <h2>History of Exploration</h2>
        <p>
          British climbers began targeting Everest in the early 1900s, but the summit remained elusive until 1953, when Sir 
          Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay succeeded, marking a historic milestone. By May 2025, thousands attempt the climb 
          annually, navigating extreme conditions for the ultimate mountaineering achievement.

        <h2>Climbing Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Starting from Lukla, Nepal, climbers face altitude sickness, with symptoms like nausea and dizziness, and extreme 
          weather—temperatures below -30°C and winds up to 200 mph. Acclimatization camps help, but avalanches and overcrowding 
          remain risks, with 2025 reports noting increased safety measures after recent incidents.

        <h2>Cultural and Scientific Significance</h2>
        <p>
          Known as Sagarmatha in Nepal, Everest is a sacred site for the Sherpa, who revere it as a divine abode. Scientificall,
          its unique conditions enable studies on climate change and high-altitude physiology—2025 research highlights glacial 
          melt accelerating at 1 meter per year, impacting local ecosystems.

        <h2>Environmental Concerns</h2>
        <p>
          Climate change and tourism threaten Everest, with melting glaciers and litter from climbers degrading the environment.
          Initiatives in 2025, including stricter waste regulations and sustainable climbing practices, aim to preserve this 
          natural wonder, ensuring its legacy for future generations amid growing global attention.
