        <h2>What Is Victoria Falls?</h2>
        <p>
          Victoria Falls, located on the Zambezi River between Zambia and Zimbabwe, is one of the world’s largest waterfalls, 
          with a height of 108 meters and an average flow of 1,088 cubic meters per second. Named by David Livingstone in 1855 
          after Queen Victoria, its local name, Mosi-oa-Tunya ("the smoke that thunders"), captures its awe-inspiring power and 
          mist, mesmerizing visitors as of May 2025.

          Part of the Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park, spanning 66 square kilometers, Victoria Falls hosts diverse wildlife like 
          elephants, giraffes, and numerous bird species. The falls’ spray sustains unique riverine forests and wetlands, 
          creating vibrant ecosystems—recent 2025 ecological surveys emphasize their role in regional biodiversity amidst
          climate pressures.

        <h2>Scientific and Economic Significance</h2>
        <p>
          The falls support research into biodiversity, climate change, and river ecology, with 2025 studies focusing on wetland
          conservation. Economically, the Kariba Dam downstream generates hydropower for Zambia and Zimbabwe, with plans for new
          plants aiming to meet growing energy demands while balancing environmental impacts.

        <h2>Challenges and Conservation</h2>
        <p>
          Climate change, deforestation, and land-use shifts threaten the falls’ ecosystems, reducing water flow—2025 data shows
          a 10% flow decrease since 2000. Conservation initiatives promote sustainable tourism and protected areas, ensuring 
          Victoria Falls remains a vital natural and cultural treasure for future generations.
