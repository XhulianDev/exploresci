        <h2>What Is Meteorology?</h2>
        <p>
          Meteorology investigates the Earth’s atmosphere, focusing on its composition, structure, and dynamics. This 
          interdisciplinary field merges physics, chemistry, and mathematics to analyze and predict atmospheric phenomena, 
          including weather and climate trends. Essential for understanding environmental processes, meteorology supports 
          sectors like agriculture, aviation, and energy management as of May 2025.

        <h2>Historical Development</h2>
        <p>
          Meteorology’s roots trace to ancient Greece, with Aristotle’s *Meteorologica* (340 BC) describing weather phenomena. 
          The field advanced in the 17th century with instruments like the barometer (Evangelista Torricelli, 1643) and 
          thermometer (Galileo, 1593). The 20th century brought weather satellites and computer models, revolutionizing 
          forecasting—by 2025, AI-enhanced models at institutions like NOAA provide unprecedented accuracy in weather
          prediction.

        <h2>Weather and Climate Prediction</h2>
        <p>
          Weather forecasting examines short-term atmospheric changes—temperature, humidity, precipitation—using tools like 
          radar, satellites, and weather balloons. Climate studies analyze long-term trends over decades, projecting shifts 
          critical for addressing climate change. In May 2025, meteorologists predict intensified storm patterns in the
          Atlantic, aiding disaster preparedness and resource planning across industries.

        <h2>Atmospheric Chemistry</h2>
        <p>
          Atmospheric chemistry explores the interactions of gases, particles, and pollutants in the atmosphere, influencing 
          cloud formation, air quality, and solar radiation absorption. Research on ozone depletion and urban smog informs 
          policies—recent 2025 studies highlight rising CO₂ levels impacting global temperatures, guiding mitigation strategies 
          for environmental and human health.

        <h2>Applications and Future Directions</h2>
        <p>
          Meteorology supports aviation safety with real-time storm tracking, informs farmers on optimal planting seasons, and 
          optimizes renewable energy production, like wind farms, with accurate forecasts. Future advancements, leveraging AI
          and quantum computing by late 2025, aim to enhance long-term climate models, improving sustainability efforts and 
          global resilience to atmospheric changes.
