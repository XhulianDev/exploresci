        <h2>What Is the Amazon Rainforest?</h2>
        <p>
          The Amazon Rainforest, stretching over 5.5 million square kilometers across nine South American countries including 
          Brazil and Peru, is the world’s largest tropical rainforest. This biodiverse ecosystem regulates global climate, 
          supports millions of species, and sustains indigenous communities, providing critical environmental services like 
          carbon sequestration and water cycle regulation as of May 2025.

        <h2>Biodiversity and Ecological Role</h2>
        <p>
          Home to approximately 40,000 plant species, 2.5 million insects, and over 2,000 bird and mammal species—including 
          jaguars and pink river dolphins—the Amazon boasts one in ten known Earth species. Its dense canopy drives primary 
          productivity, while its role as the world’s largest carbon sink absorbs 2 billion tons of CO₂ annually, mitigating 
          climate change, with recent 2025 studies underscoring its ecological significance.

      <section>
        <h2>Water Cycle Contribution</h2>
        <p>
          The Amazon acts as a natural water regulator, absorbing rainfall during the wet season and releasing it during dry 
          periods, sustaining the Amazon River and regional agriculture. This “flying rivers” phenomenon, where moisture is 
          transported inland, supports ecosystems and human livelihoods, with 2025 satellite data highlighting its role amid 
          shifting precipitation patterns.

        <h2>Threats from Deforestation</h2>
        <p>
          Deforestation, with 17% of the forest lost since the 1970s, threatens the Amazon, driven by cattle ranching, soybean 
          farming, logging, and mining. This has led to increased CO₂ emissions, biodiversity loss, and soil degradation, 
          impacting 30 million people, including indigenous groups. May 2025 reports indicate accelerated clearing due to 
          agricultural expansion in Brazil.

        <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
        <p>
          Conservation strategies focus on securing indigenous land rights, promoting sustainable practices, and reducing global
          demand for deforestation-linked products like beef. International initiatives, including the 2025 Amazon Fund 
          expansion, aim to combat illegal logging and enhance reforestation, fostering collaboration to preserve this vital 
          ecosystem for future generations.
