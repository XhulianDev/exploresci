        <h2>What Is Mauna Loa?</h2>
        <p>
          Mauna Loa, a colossal shield volcano on Hawaii’s Big Island, stands 4,169 meters (13,678 feet) above sea level, with a
          total height exceeding 9,000 meters from the seafloor. Known as the "long mountain" in Hawaiian,
          its 5,271-square-kilometer shield and active eruptions make it a global geological marvel as of May 2025.

        <h2>Geological History</h2>
        <p>
          Estimated at 600,000 to 1 million years old, Mauna Loa emerges from the Hawaiian hot spot, fueling the island chain’s 
          formation as the Pacific plate shifts. Its 3-kilometer-wide caldera and effusive lava flows, active for 35 years, 
          shape the landscape—2025 seismic data tracks its ongoing activity, aiding hazard prediction.

        <h2>Ecosystem and Cultural Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Mauna Loa’s lava flows create diverse habitats for unique flora and fauna, while its fertile slopes support 
          agriculture. Sacred to native Hawaiians, it features in myths and ceremonies—recent 2025 cultural programs highlight
          its spiritual role, blending tradition with tourism as visitors explore its trails.

        <h2>Scientific Research</h2>
        <p>
          Equipped with monitoring stations for seismic and gas data, Mauna Loa is a key volcanology site, offering insights 
          into magma dynamics and climate impacts. In May 2025, researchers study its hot spot connection, enhancing global 
          volcanic hazard models and ecological studies.

        <h2>Challenges and Community Life</h2>
        <p>
          Despite eruption risks, communities thrive on Mauna Loa’s slopes for its rich soils, though evacuation readiness is 
          critical—2025 saw improved warning systems. Balancing tourism, research, and safety, efforts preserve its natural and 
          cultural legacy amid ongoing volcanic activity.
