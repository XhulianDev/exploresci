        <h2>What Is the Great Blue Hole?</h2>
        <p>
          The Great Blue Hole, a mesmerizing sinkhole off Belize’s coast in the Caribbean Sea, spans 1,000 feet across and 400 
          feet deep. Part of the UNESCO-listed Belize Barrier Reef, its crystal-clear blue waters and surrounding coral reefs 
          make it a premier diving destination, drawing global adventurers and researchers as of May 2025.

        <h2>Geological Origins</h2>
        <p>
          Formed around 10,000 years ago during the last Ice Age, the Great Blue Hole emerged when rising sea levels submerged 
          a limestone shelf, causing its roof to collapse. This ancient geological process created a near-perfect circular 
          sinkhole, offering a window into Earth’s climatic past, with ongoing studies in 2025 exploring its sediment layers.

        <h2>Marine Biodiversity</h2>
        <p>
          The hole teems with marine life, hosting hammerhead and bull sharks, nurse sharks, stingrays, and diverse corals like 
          staghorn and brain coral. Its underwater caves and tunnels shelter lobsters and crabs, while 130-foot visibility 
          enhances exploration. Recent 2025 surveys note thriving ecosystems despite regional pressures.

          and marine biology. Culturally, it holds significance for the Maya, who viewed it as a portal to the underworld, and 
          it symbolizes Belizean pride, featured on the national flag and currency as of May 2025.
