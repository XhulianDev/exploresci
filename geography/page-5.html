        <h2>What Is the Grand Canyon?</h2>
        <p>
          The Grand Canyon, located in Arizona, USA, is a breathtaking natural wonder stretching 277 miles (446 km) long, up to 
          18 miles (29 km) wide, and over a mile (1.6 km) deep. Carved into the Colorado Plateau, its vibrant rock layers and 
          intricate formations have drawn global fascination, serving as a testament to Earth’s geological history and a hub
          for scientific study as of May 2025.

        <h2>Geological Formation</h2>
        <p>
          Formed over millions of years by the Colorado River’s erosion, the Grand Canyon exposes rocks dating back 2 billion 
          years, including ancient granite and the Vishnu Schist (1.7 billion years old). Its layers span the
          Paleozoic (limestone, sandstone), Mesozoic (sandstone, volcanic rocks), and Cenozoic (conglomerate) eras,
          with colorful formations like the Bright Angel Shale showcasing reds and purples, revealing Earth’s dynamic past.

        <h2>Ecosystem and Biodiversity</h2>
        <p>
          The Grand Canyon’s varied topography supports over 1,500 plant species—like ponderosa pines—and diverse wildlife, 
          including elk, bighorn sheep, and mountain lions. The Colorado River sustains fish such as the humpback chub, while 
          providing water for the ecosystem. Recent 2025 surveys highlight the canyon’s role as a critical habitat amid climate 
          shifts.

        <h2>Visitor Experiences</h2>
        <p>
          Grand Canyon National Park, established in 1919 and spanning 1.2 million acres, offers hiking trails, mule rides, and 
          scenic flights. Trails range from rim walks to strenuous descents, while ranger-led programs educate on the canyon’s 
          history. In May 2025, the park welcomed record visitors, emphasizing its allure as a global destination.

        <h2>Scientific Significance</h2>
        <p>
          The Grand Canyon serves as a natural laboratory for geology, ecology, and environmental science. Scientists study its 
          rocks and fossils to trace Earth’s history and species evolution, while 2025 research focuses on climate change 
          impacts and water management, underscoring the canyon’s role in understanding global environmental challenges.
