        <h2>What Is Oceanography?</h2>
        <p>
          Oceanography is the scientific exploration of Earth’s oceans, which cover over 70% of the planet’s surface and are 
          pivotal in regulating climate, weather, and biogeochemical cycles. This multidisciplinary field integrates physics, 
          chemistry, biology, and geology to study ocean properties, interactions with the atmosphere and land, and their 
          influence on human society. As of May 2025, oceanography addresses pressing issues like climate change and marine 
          conservation, making it essential for global sustainability.

        <h2>Historical Development</h2>
        <p>
          Oceanography began to take shape in the 19th century with the HMS Challenger expedition (1872–1876), which mapped 
          ocean floors and collected biological samples, laying the foundation for modern marine science. Early pioneers like 
          Matthew Fontaine Maury analyzed ocean currents in the 1840s, while the 20th century saw advancements with sonar 
          technology and deep-sea submersibles. The establishment of institutions like the Scripps Institution of Oceanography 
          in 1903 further propelled research into ocean dynamics and climate.

        <h2>Physical Oceanography</h2>
        <p>
          Physical oceanography examines seawater’s physical traits—temperature, salinity, density—and processes like 
          circulation, waves, and tides. Ocean circulation, driven by wind, tides, and density gradients, redistributes heat and
          nutrients, influencing climate patterns—recent 2025 studies highlight its role in the North Atlantic’s warming. Waves,
          caused by wind, and tides, driven by lunar and solar gravity, shape coastlines and support energy projects, while 
          research aidsn tsunami preparedness.

        <h2>Chemical Oceanography</h2>
        <p>
          Chemical oceanography analyzes the ocean’s chemical makeup and cycles, focusing on nutrients, carbon, and pollutants. 
          Ocean acidification, intensified by atmospheric CO₂ absorption, threatens marine life like coral reefs—data from May 
          2025 shows a pH drop of 0.1 since pre-industrial levels. Nutrient cycles, disrupted by human pollution, cause 
          eutrophication and algal blooms, prompting oceanographers to develop mitigation strategies for marine health.

      <section>
        <h2>Biological Oceanography</h2>
        <p>
          Biological oceanography studies marine life and ecosystems, from phytoplankton to deep-sea organisms. Primary 
          productivity by phytoplankton drives the marine food web and carbon sequestration, critical for climate regulation. 
          Fisheries science monitors fish populations for sustainable harvesting, while biodiversity research, enhanced by 
          underwater robotics in 2025, uncovers new species, supporting conservation and bioprospecting for pharmaceuticals.

        <h2>Human Interactions and Future Prospects</h2>
        <p>
          Oceanography informs the sustainable use of ocean resources—fish, minerals, and renewable energy like tidal 
          power—while addressing human impacts like overfishing and pollution. Shipping routes depend on ocean data, and climate
          models rely on ocean currents to predict 2025’s extreme weather. Future efforts focus on deep-sea exploration,
          AI-driven ocean monitoring, and carbon capture technologies, ensuring the oceans’ resilience amid global challenges.
