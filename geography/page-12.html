        <h2>What Is the Sahara Desert?</h2>
        <p>
          The Sahara Desert, spanning over 9.2 million square kilometers across 11 North African countries, is the world’s 
          largest hot desert. Known for its extreme temperatures—up to 58°C (136°F)—and vast dunes, it captivates researchers 
          and explorers with its harsh yet resilient ecosystem as of May 2025.

        <h2>Geological and Climate History</h2>
        <p>
          Once a fertile region 3 million years ago, the Sahara turned arid due to climate shifts and human impact. Its 
          southward expansion by 10% over the past century, driven by rising temperatures and scant rainfall (less than 25 mm 
          annually), reflects ongoing desertification—2025 climate models highlight accelerated trends.

        <h2>Ecology and Adaptation</h2>
        <p>
          Despite its aridity, the Sahara supports adapted species like camels, gazelles, and scorpions. Vegetation is sparse 
          but resilient, with plants thriving in oases—recent 2025 studies note increased species diversity near water sources 
          amid efforts to combat desert spread.

        <h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>
        <p>
          Home to ancient civilizations like the Egyptians and Tuaregs, the Sahara boasts Timbuktu’s Djinguereber Mosque and 
          prehistoric rock art. These sites, preserved through centuries, reflect a rich cultural legacy, with 2025 festivals 
          celebrating this heritage amid modern challenges.

        <h2>Challenges and Sustainability</h2>
        <p>
          Desertification, worsened by deforestation and overgrazing, threatens the Sahara, while water scarcity intensifies 
          with climate change. May 2025 initiatives promote sustainable farming and solar energy, aiming to mitigate 
          environmental degradation and support local communities.
