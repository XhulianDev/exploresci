        <h2>What is Philosophy of Science?</h2>
        <p>
          Philosophy of science examines the foundations, methods, and implications of scientific inquiry. It asks questions 
          like: What makes a theory scientific? How do we distinguish science from pseudoscience? By analyzing the nature of 
          evidence, explanation, and discovery, this field clarifies how science generates knowledge and shapes our 
          understanding of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          With roots in the works of philosophers like Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn, philosophy of science bridges science and 
          philosophy, offering insights into the processes that drive technological and intellectual progress.

        <h2>Scientific Method and Falsifiability</h2>
        <p>
          The scientific method involves forming hypotheses, testing them through experiments, and refining theories based on 
          evidence. Karl Popper emphasized falsifiability as a hallmark of science: a scientific theory must be testable and 
          potentially disprovable. For example, Einstein’s theory of relativity could be tested through observable predictions, 
          unlike untestable claims like astrology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Falsifiability helps demarcate science from non-science, ensuring theories are grounded in empirical evidence and
          open to revision, fostering rigorous inquiry.
        </p>

        <h2>Paradigms and Scientific Revolutions</h2>
        <p>
          Thomas Kuhn introduced the concept of paradigms—frameworks of assumptions and methods that guide scientific research. 
          Normal science operates within a paradigm, but anomalies can lead to paradigm shifts, or scientific revolutions. For 
          instance, Copernicus’ heliocentric model replaced the geocentric paradigm, fundamentally changing astronomy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kuhn’s ideas highlight the dynamic nature of science, showing how progress often involves radical changes in 
          perspective, influencing fields from physics to biology.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Science and Objectivity</h2>
        <p>
          Philosophy of science questions whether science is fully objective. Factors like funding, cultural biases, or 
          scientists’ values can influence research. Philosophers like Helen Longino argue that objectivity emerges from 
          critical scrutiny within scientific communities, not from individual neutrality. For example, peer review helps
          ensure robust findings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding these dynamics encourages transparency and ethical practices in science, ensuring research serves
          the public good while maintaining credibility.
        </p>

        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Philosophy of science impacts various areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Research:</strong> Guiding the design of experiments to meet scientific standards.</li>
          <li><strong>Policy:</strong> Informing decisions on climate change based on scientific evidence.</li>
          <li><strong>Education:</strong> Teaching critical evaluation of scientific claims.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These applications underscore the role of philosophical analysis in strengthening the reliability and impact of 
          scientific work.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Philosophy of science illuminates the principles and practices that define scientific inquiry, from falsifiability to 
          paradigm shifts. By exploring these concepts, we gain a deeper appreciation for how science advances knowledge, 
          fostering critical thinking and ethical responsibility in research and its applications across society.
