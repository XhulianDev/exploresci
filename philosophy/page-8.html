        <h2>What is Political Philosophy?</h2>
        <p>
          Political philosophy examines the principles governing societies, focusing on concepts like justice, authority, 
          liberty, and the organization of power. It asks questions such as: What makes a government legitimate? How should 
          resources be distributed? By exploring these issues, political philosophy shapes laws, policies, and ethical 
          governance, influencing how we coexist.
        </p>
        <p>
          This field draws on the ideas of thinkers like Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, offering frameworks to evaluate and
          design political systems that balance individual rights with collective needs.

        <h2>The Social Contract</h2>
        <p>
          The social contract theory, developed by philosophers like Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, 
          posits that individuals consent, implicitly or explicitly, to form a society governed by shared rules. Hobbes argued 
          that people surrender absolute freedom to a strong ruler to escape a chaotic “state of nature.” Locke emphasized 
          consent and the protection of natural rights (life, liberty, property), while Rousseau focused on collective will for 
          the common good.
        </p>
        <p>
          These ideas underpin modern democracies, shaping debates about the balance between security, freedom, and equality in 
          governance.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Justice and Fairness</h2>
        <p>
          Justice is a core concern of political philosophy, addressing how resources, opportunities, and punishments should be 
          distributed. John Rawls’ “veil of ignorance” proposes designing a society without knowing one’s own position,
          ensuring fairness. In contrast, Robert Nozick emphasized individual entitlements, arguing against redistributive 
          policies that infringe on personal property.
        </p>
        <p>
          These competing views inform policies on taxation, welfare, and criminal justice, highlighting the challenge of 
          creating equitable systems in diverse societies.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Authority and Legitimacy</h2>
        <p>
          Political philosophy explores what makes authority legitimate. Is it derived from divine right, popular consent, or 
          effective governance? Max Weber identified types of authority—traditional, charismatic, and rational-legal—each 
          shaping how power is justified. For example, democratic legitimacy relies on elections, while authoritarian regimes 
          may depend on tradition or force.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding legitimacy helps us evaluate governments and advocate for systems that align with ethical principles
          and public needs.
        </p>

        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Political philosophy guides real-world issues:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Policy-Making:</strong> Designing fair tax systems based on justice principles.</li>
          <li><strong>Human Rights:</strong> Justifying freedoms like speech and equality.</li>
          <li><strong>International Relations:</strong> Balancing sovereignty with global cooperation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Its insights help societies navigate conflicts, promote fairness, and build governance structures that reflect
          shared values.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Political philosophy provides tools to understand and shape societies, from the social contract to justice and 
          authority. By engaging with thinkers like Hobbes, Locke, and Rawls, we gain clarity on how to balance individual 
          rights with collective goals, fostering ethical governance and informed citizenship in a complex world.
