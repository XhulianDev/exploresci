        <h2>What is Logic?</h2>
        <p>
          Logic is the philosophical study of valid reasoning, providing tools to evaluate arguments and distinguish sound 
          conclusions from flawed ones. It forms the backbone of critical thinking, enabling us to analyze claims
          systematically. By applying logical principles, we can make informed decisions and construct persuasive arguments in 
          science, law, and everyday life.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a foundational discipline, logic enhances clarity and precision, helping us navigate complex information and avoid 
          errors in judgment across various contexts.
        </p>

        <h2>Structure of Arguments</h2>
        <p>
          An argument consists of premises (statements assumed to be true) and a conclusion (the claim supported by
          the premises). For example, in the argument “All humans are mortal; Socrates is human; therefore, Socrates is
          mortal,” the premises logically lead to the conclusion. Arguments are valid if the conclusion follows necessarily
          from the premises, and sound if the premises are true.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding argument structure is crucial for evaluating debates, from political speeches to scientific
          claims, ensuring conclusions are well-supported.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Deductive and Inductive Reasoning</h2>
        <p>
          Deductive reasoning moves from general principles to specific conclusions, guaranteeing truth if premises are true,
          as in the Socrates example. Inductive reasoning generalizes from specific observations, like concluding “the sun
          rises daily” based on past sunrises, offering probable but not certain conclusions. Both methods are essential
          in reasoning, with deduction ensuring certainty and induction supporting scientific discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recognizing these forms helps us assess the strength of arguments and apply appropriate reasoning in
          problem-solving and research.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Logical Fallacies</h2>
        <p>
          Logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that undermine arguments. Common examples include the ad hominem
          fallacy (attacking a person instead of their argument), strawman fallacy (misrepresenting an opponent’s position),
          and false dilemma (presenting only two options when more exist). Identifying fallacies strengthens critical
          thinking, enabling us to spot weak arguments in media or debates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Avoiding fallacies ensures clearer communication and more robust conclusions, vital in discussions and
          decision-making processes.
        </p>

        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Logic and critical thinking are applied in many areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Law:</strong> Constructing valid arguments in courtroom defenses.</li>
          <li><strong>Science:</strong> Designing experiments with sound reasoning.</li>
          <li><strong>Education:</strong> Teaching students to evaluate sources critically.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These skills empower individuals to analyze information, make reasoned decisions, and engage effectively
          in intellectual and civic life.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Logic and critical thinking provide essential tools for reasoning, enabling us to evaluate arguments, avoid
          fallacies, and make informed decisions. By mastering deductive and inductive reasoning, we enhance our ability
          to navigate complex issues, fostering clarity and intellectual rigor in personal and professional contexts.
