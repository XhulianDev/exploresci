        <h2>What is Ethics?</h2>
        <p>
          Ethics, a major branch of philosophy, studies concepts of right and wrong, guiding how individuals and societies make 
          moral decisions. It explores questions like: What actions are morally permissible? How should we treat others? Unlike 
          personal opinions, ethics seeks universal principles to evaluate behavior, influencing laws, relationships, and 
          professional conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          By examining moral frameworks, ethics helps us navigate complex dilemmas, from personal choices to global issues, 
          fostering a deeper understanding of human values and responsibilities.

        <h2>Utilitarianism: The Greatest Good</h2>
        <p>
          Utilitarianism, proposed by philosophers like Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, argues that the right action 
          maximizes overall happiness or minimizes suffering. It evaluates consequences: an action is moral if it produces the 
          greatest good for the greatest number. For example, donating to charity might be moral if it benefits many people.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach is practical in policy-making but faces challenges, such as balancing individual rights against 
          collective benefits, prompting debates about fairness and justice.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Deontology: Duty and Rules</h2>
        <p>
          Deontology, championed by Immanuel Kant, focuses on rules and duties rather than consequences. An action is right if 
          it follows universal moral principles, like honesty or respect for others. For instance, lying is wrong, even if it 
          leads to a positive outcome, because it violates a moral duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deontology provides clear guidelines for behavior but can be rigid, raising questions about how to handle conflicting 
          duties in complex situations.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Virtue Ethics: Character and Flourishing</h2>
        <p>
          Virtue ethics, rooted in Aristotle’s philosophy, emphasizes developing good character traits, or virtues, like
          courage, honesty, and compassion. A moral action aligns with these virtues, contributing to personal and societal 
          flourishing. For example, a virtuous person might help a stranger out of genuine kindness, not obligation.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach focuses on long-term character development but can be subjective, as different cultures prioritize 
          different virtues, complicating universal standards.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Ethics shapes decisions in various fields:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Medicine:</strong> Deciding whether to prioritize patient autonomy or life-saving treatment.</li>
          <li><strong>Business:</strong> Ensuring fair labor practices and honest marketing.</li>
          <li><strong>Law:</strong> Balancing punishment with rehabilitation in justice systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Ethical reasoning helps individuals and organizations address dilemmas with clarity and integrity, promoting trust
          and fairness.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Ethics and morality provide frameworks to evaluate right and wrong, guiding personal and societal choices. Through 
          utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics, we explore diverse perspectives on moral decision-making. These tools 
          foster critical thinking and ethical awareness, essential for navigating life’s complex challenges responsibly.
