        <h2>What is Philosophy?</h2>
        <p>
          Philosophy, derived from the Greek words for "love of wisdom," is the study of fundamental questions about existence, 
          knowledge, values, reason, and beauty. Unlike science, which relies on empirical data, philosophy uses reasoning and 
          critical thinking to explore abstract concepts that shape our understanding of the world and ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Philosophy encourages asking "why" and "how," fostering curiosity and reflection. It is not about finding definitive 
          answers but about deepening our understanding through inquiry, making it a vital tool for navigating complex human 
          experiences.

        <h2>Branches of Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          Philosophy is divided into several key branches, each addressing distinct questions. These branches provide a 
          framework for exploring the nature of reality, knowledge, and human behavior, offering diverse perspectives on life’s 
          big questions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Metaphysics:</strong> Examines the nature of reality, including questions about existence, objects, and 
              the universe.</li>
          <li><strong>Epistemology:</strong> Studies knowledge, truth, and the justification of beliefs.</li>
          <li><strong>Ethics:</strong> Explores concepts of right and wrong, guiding moral decision-making.</li>
          <li><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> Investigates beauty, art, and aesthetic experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Logic:</strong> Analyzes reasoning and the structure of valid arguments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each branch contributes uniquely to philosophical inquiry, shaping how we think about the world and our place in it.

        <h2>Why Study Philosophy?</h2>
        <p>
          Studying philosophy sharpens critical thinking, encourages open-mindedness, and helps us address complex ethical and 
          existential questions. It equips individuals to analyze arguments, question assumptions, and make reasoned decisions, 
          skills valuable in law, education, science, and everyday life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Philosophy also fosters self-reflection, helping us understand our values and beliefs. From debating moral dilemmas
          to exploring the meaning of life, it provides tools to navigate uncertainty and complexity with clarity.

        <p>
          Philosophy has practical implications across disciplines:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ethics in Medicine:</strong> Guiding decisions about patient care and medical dilemmas.</li>
          <li><strong>Law:</strong> Shaping arguments about justice and rights.</li>
          <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Addressing ethical concerns in artificial intelligence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By engaging with philosophical questions, we develop a deeper understanding of human thought and societal challenges.
