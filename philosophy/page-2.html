        <h2>What is Epistemology?</h2>
        <p>
          Epistemology, a core branch of philosophy, investigates the nature, sources, and limits of knowledge. It asks 
          fundamental questions: What is knowledge? How do we acquire it? Can we be certain of what we know? By exploring these 
          issues, epistemology seeks to understand the foundations of human understanding and distinguish between justified 
          beliefs and mere opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This field is crucial for evaluating claims in science, education, and everyday life, helping us navigate the 
          complexities of truth and certainty in a world full of information.
        </p>

        <h2>Defining Knowledge</h2>
        <p>
          A common definition of knowledge is "justified true belief." For something to count as knowledge, it must be
          believed, true, and supported by sufficient evidence or justification. For example, believing the sun will rise 
          tomorrow is knowledge if it’s based on consistent evidence, not just a guess. However, this definition faces 
          challenges, such as cases where justified beliefs turn out to be false.
        </p>
        <p>
          Philosophers like Plato have debated this concept for centuries, refining our understanding of what it means to truly 
          "know" something, impacting how we assess claims in various fields.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Sources of Knowledge</h2>
        <p>
          Epistemology examines how we gain knowledge, with key sources including perception (senses), reason (logic),
          testimony (others’ accounts), and memory. Rationalists argue that reason is the primary source, as senses can be 
          deceptive, while empiricists emphasize sensory experience as the foundation. For instance, knowing the smell of rain 
          relies on perception, but deducing a mathematical proof depends on reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding these sources helps us evaluate the reliability of information, from scientific data to personal 
          experiences, fostering critical thinking in decision-making.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Skepticism and the Limits of Knowledge</h2>
        <p>
          Skepticism challenges our certainty, questioning whether we can truly know anything. Philosophers like René Descartes 
          proposed thought experiments, like the "evil demon" deceiving our senses, to test the limits of knowledge. While 
          extreme skepticism doubts all beliefs, moderate skepticism encourages questioning assumptions to strengthen 
          understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach is valuable in science and law, where rigorous testing of claims ensures accuracy, helping us 
          distinguish between well-founded knowledge and unverified assumptions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Epistemology influences many areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Science:</strong> Evaluating evidence to validate theories.</li>
          <li><strong>Education:</strong> Teaching critical thinking to assess sources.</li>
          <li><strong>Journalism:</strong> Verifying information to avoid misinformation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By applying epistemological principles, we enhance our ability to discern truth and make informed decisions in a 
          complex world.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Epistemology invites us to question what we know and how we know it, sharpening our understanding of truth and
          belief. By exploring the nature, sources, and limits of knowledge, it equips us with tools to critically evaluate 
          information and navigate uncertainty, making it essential for intellectual and practical pursuits.
