        <h2>What Are Cougars?</h2>
        <p>
          Cougars (Puma concolor), also called mountain lions or panthers, are large felids spanning from southern Canada to 
          Patagonia. Solitary and elusive, their powerful build and stealth make them adaptable predators across diverse 
          habitats as of May 2025.

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          Cougars feature a muscular, tawny-to-gray coat, broad head, and long hind legs for leaping up to 40 feet. Their 
          retractable claws and strong jaws enable them to tackle prey larger than themselves, showcasing their hunting 
          prowess.

        <h2>Habitat and Behavior</h2>
        <p>
          Thriving in forests, deserts, and urban edges, cougars defend vast territories—sometimes hundreds of square miles. 
          Stealth hunters, they stalk deer and elk with keen senses, relying on patience for sudden attacks, as noted in 2025 
          studies.

        <h2>Ecological Role</h2>
        <p>
          As apex predators, cougars regulate ungulate populations, maintaining ecosystem balance. Their predation prevents 
          overgrazing—2025 research highlights their role in restoring vegetation health in rewilded regions like the American 
          West.

        <h2>Conservation Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Facing habitat loss, hunting, and human conflict, cougar populations have rebounded in some areas due to conservation.
          May 2025 efforts focus on habitat protection and conflict reduction, ensuring their ecological and cultural 
          significance persists.
