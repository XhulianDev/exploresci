        <h2>What Are Jaguars?</h2>
        <p>
          Jaguars (Panthera onca), the third-largest cats after lions and tigers, inhabit the Americas from the southern U.S. 
          to Argentina. Part of the Panthera genus, these solitary, elusive predators are renowned for their golden-brown coats 
          with black rosettes, thriving as apex hunters as of May 2025.

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          Jaguars feature robust builds with exceptionally strong jaws, capable of crushing prey skulls. Their spotted coats 
          provide camouflage, while their swimming prowess sets them apart among big cats. Agile and muscular, they excel in 
          diverse terrains, from forests to wetlands.

        <h2>Behavior and Ecology</h2>
        <p>
          Solitary and territorial, jaguars stalk prey like deer and caimans with stealth, using patience to strike. They 
          maintain ecological balance by controlling prey populations and dispersing seeds via fruit consumption—2025 studies 
          note their role in wetland ecosystems amid habitat shifts.

        <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
          Jaguars roam tropical forests, grasslands, and wetlands, requiring vast territories spanning hundreds of square miles.
          Habitat loss from agriculture and infrastructure has fragmented their range—May 2025 data estimates their population 
          at under 170,000, driving conservation urgency.

        <h2>Conservation Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN, jaguars face declines from habitat loss, hunting, and poaching for fur. 
          Conservation in 2025 includes protected areas, anti-poaching patrols, and community programs to reduce human conflict,
          ensuring their survival in the wild.
