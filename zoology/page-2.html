        <h2>What Are Crocodiles?</h2>
        <p>
          Crocodiles, ancient semi-aquatic reptiles of the Crocodylidae family, have thrived for millions of years. With 14 
          species, including the massive saltwater crocodile (up to 23 feet, over 2,000 pounds), they inhabit tropical and 
          subtropical regions worldwide, embodying raw power as apex predators as of May 2025.

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          Crocodiles boast long, powerful jaws with a bite force exceeding 3,000 pounds per square inch, lined with sharp teeth.
          Their tough, scaly skin offers protection and moisture retention. Built for aquatic life, they use strong tails for 
          swimming, thriving in rivers, lakes, and swamps across warm climates.

        <h2>Behavior and Social Structure</h2>
        <p>
          As ambush predators, crocodiles hunt fish, birds, and mammals with precision, using stealth and speed. Despite their 
          ferocity, they exhibit social behaviors—females fiercely guard their young, and groups communicate via grunts and 
          roars. Recent 2025 studies reveal complex vocal patterns strengthening group bonds.

        <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
          Crocodiles favor warm, humid aquatic habitats like swamps and rivers in regions such as Africa, Australia, and the 
          Americas. Their ability to remain submerged for extended periods makes them adept hunters—2025 ecological surveys note
          habitat shifts due to climate change affecting their distribution.

        <h2>Conservation Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Hunted for skin and meat, many crocodile species are endangered, with populations declining due to habitat loss and 
          poaching. Conservation efforts in 2025 focus on habitat restoration, anti-poaching measures, and public education to 
          reduce demand, aiming to secure their future in the wild.
