        <h2>What Are Tigers?</h2>
        <p>
          Tigers (Panthera tigris), the largest cats in the Felidae family, encompass five endangered subspecies: Bengal, 
          Indochinese, Siberian, Malayan, and Sumatran. Renowned for their orange coats with black stripes, they are apex 
          predators, shaping ecosystems across Asia despite a 40% population decline over the past decade as of May 2025.

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          Tigers boast powerful jaws, sharp teeth, and a muscular build, ideal for hunting large prey. Their iconic
          striped coats provide camouflage, though variations like the white Bengal tiger exist. Skilled swimmers, they navigate
          rivers to hunt or claim territories, showcasing adaptability in diverse environments.

        <h2>Behavior and Ecology</h2>
        <p>
          Primarily solitary, tigers hunt with stealth, stalking prey like deer and boars for hours before striking. Males may 
          form coalitions, while females fiercely guard cubs. Requiring vast territories—up to hundreds of square miles—they 
          thrive in forests, grasslands, and wetlands, maintaining ecological balance as apex predators.

        <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
          Tigers inhabit tropical forests, grasslands, and wetlands across Asia, but habitat loss has shrunk their range. Once 
          widespread, they now face fragmentation due to agriculture and urbanization—2025 surveys estimate only 3,900 wild 
          tigers remain, underscoring the urgent need for habitat preservation.

        <h2>Conservation Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Listed as endangered by the IUCN, tigers suffer from habitat loss and poaching for fur and bones used in traditional 
          medicine. May 2025 initiatives, including protected areas, anti-poaching patrols, and community programs, aim to 
          reduce human-tiger conflict and ensure their survival through sustainable practices.
