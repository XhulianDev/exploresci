        <h2>What Are Leopards?</h2>
          Leopards (Panthera pardus), agile big cats, thrive across Africa and Asia in diverse habitats like rainforests, 
          deserts, and savannas. Known for their stealth and adaptability, these solitary hunters prey on small mammals to 
          larger ungulates, playing a key ecological role as of May 2025.

        <h2>Distribution and Habitat</h2>
          Found from sub-Saharan Africa to Asia, including India and China, leopards adapt to varied environments—from forests 
          to urban fringes. Their home ranges span a few to hundreds of square kilometers, depending on prey availability, with 
          2025 data showing increased urban encroachment challenges.

        <h2>Behavior and Hunting</h2>
          Nocturnal and solitary, leopards excel in stealth, leaping up to six meters to ambush prey like antelopes or birds. 
          They drag kills into trees to avoid scavengers, showcasing strength and agility. Their swimming skills aid in crossing
          rivers, enhancing their hunting range.

        <h2>Reproduction and Life Cycle</h2>
          Leopards mature at 2–3 years, with females birthing 1–6 cubs after a 90–105-day gestation. Cubs rely on their mother 
          for 18–24 months before gaining independence. Living up to 20 years, most survive 10–12 years—2025 studies note 
          declining cub survival due to habitat pressures.

        <h2>Conservation Challenges</h2>
          Leopards face habitat loss, poaching, and human conflict, threatening their survival. Conservation in 2025 emphasizes 
          protected areas, anti-poaching efforts, and conflict mitigation, ensuring these adaptable cats continue to thrive 
          across their diverse habitats.
