        <h2>What Is the Komodo Dragon?</h2>
        <p>
          The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), native to Indonesian islands like Komodo and Rinca, is the world’s largest 
          lizard, reaching 10 feet and over 150 pounds. An apex predator, it hunts deer, pigs, and buffalo, dominating its 
          ecosystem as of May 2025.

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          Komodo dragons feature mottled gray-brown skin with osteoderms, powerful legs, and a muscular tail used for balance 
          and defense. Their jaws, armed with serrated teeth, deliver venomous bites causing rapid blood loss and paralysis,
          an adaptation enhancing their active hunting strategy.

        <h2>Hunting and Adaptations</h2>
        <p>
          With a unique respiratory system—long trachea and enlarged lungs—Komodo dragons chase prey efficiently. Their venom, 
          packed with toxic proteins, ensures quick kills. They strike with precision, often ambushing larger animals, as 
          observed in 2025 field studies on Rinca Island.

        <h2>Habitat and Threats</h2>
        <p>
          Komodo dragons inhabit a limited range, making them vulnerable to habitat loss from logging, agriculture, and natural 
          disasters like earthquakes. Poaching for illegal trade further threatens their survival, with 2025 estimates showing 
          only 4,000–5,000 individuals remaining in the wild.

        <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
        <p>
          Classified as vulnerable by the IUCN, Komodo dragons benefit from protected areas like Komodo National Park, home to 
          2,500 individuals. Captive breeding programs, such as the Komodo Survival Program in 2025, aim to boost genetic 
          diversity and support reintroduction, ensuring their long-term survival.
