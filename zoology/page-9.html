        <h2>What Are Wolves?</h2>
        <p>
          Wolves (Canis lupus), the largest Canidae family members, are intelligent, social predators. Males weigh 70–110
          pounds, females 50–85 pounds, with broad heads and powerful jaws. Once widespread, gray wolves in the U.S. now number 
          around 6,000, a recovery from near extinction by May 2025.

        <h2>Social Structure</h2>
        <p>
          Wolves live in packs led by an alpha pair, including their offspring and related members. They communicate via howls, 
          growls, and scent marking, fostering pack loyalty. In 2025, studies show packs adapting to fragmented habitats, 
          strengthening social bonds for survival.

        <h2>Ecological Role</h2>
        <p>
          As apex predators, wolves regulate prey like deer and elk, benefiting plant communities and balancing predator 
          populations like coyotes. Their predation prevents overgrazing—2025 research highlights their role in restoring 
          ecological balance in Yellowstone after reintroduction.

        <h2>Diet and Hunting</h2>
        <p>
          Primarily carnivorous, wolves hunt elk, deer, and smaller mammals, often scavenging or eating plants.
          They use teamwork to take down prey, with howls coordinating hunts. Recent 2025 observations note increased scavenging
          in areas with reduced prey due to habitat loss.

      <section>
        <h2>Conservation Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Wolves face habitat loss, human conflict, and diseases like parvovirus. Protected under the U.S. Endangered Species 
          Act, their population grows, but persecution persists. May 2025 efforts focus on habitat restoration, reintroduction, 
          and education to reduce conflicts and ensure their survival.
