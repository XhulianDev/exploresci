        <h2>What Are Lions?</h2>
        <p>
          Lions (Panthera leo), iconic members of the Felidae family, are apex predators and the only cats living in
          social groups called prides. As keystone species, they regulate ecosystems by controlling prey populations.
          Once widespread from Europe to India, their range has shrunk to sub-Saharan Africa and a small pocket in India by
          May 2025.

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          The second-largest cats after tigers, male lions weigh 330–550 pounds with distinctive manes, while females weigh 
          265–400 pounds. Their sandy to reddish-brown fur, muscular build, and sharp senses—excellent vision and hearing—equip 
          them for hunting. Their roars, audible up to 8 kilometers, assert dominance and coordinate prides.

        <h2>Social Structure and Behavior</h2>
        <p>
          Prides consist of related females, their cubs, and a few males, often unrelated, who defend territories. Females hunt 
          cooperatively, targeting large prey like zebras, while males protect the pride. Social bonds are reinforced through 
          grooming and play—2025 studies highlight increased pride cohesion in response to habitat pressures.

        <h2>Reproduction and Life Cycle</h2>
        <p>
          Females mature at 2–3 years, males at 4–5. After a 110-day gestation, females birth 1–6 cubs, weighing 3–4 pounds. 
          Cubs nurse for months, staying with their mother for two years. Males leave to form new prides, while females
          often remain—recent 2025 data shows cub survival rates declining due to habitat loss.

        <h2>Conservation Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Lions face a 43% population decline over two decades, deemed vulnerable by the IUCN in 2025. Habitat fragmentation, 
          poaching, and human conflict threaten their survival. Conservation efforts, including protected areas and community 
          programs, aim to mitigate these risks, ensuring lions thrive for future generations.
