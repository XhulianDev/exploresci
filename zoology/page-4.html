        <h2>What Are Eagles?</h2>
        <p>
          Eagles, majestic birds of prey in the Accipitridae family, span over 60 species worldwide, excluding Antarctica. From 
          the small South Nicobar Serpent Eagle to the Philippine Eagle with a 7-foot wingspan, they symbolize strength. Common 
          species like the Bald and Golden Eagles dominate North America as of May 2025.

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          Eagles possess sharp talons for seizing prey, hooked beaks for tearing flesh, and large wings for soaring. Their keen 
          eyesight spots prey from afar—Bald Eagles excel at fishing, while Golden Eagles tackle diverse prey. Their muscular 
          build supports carrying heavy loads, showcasing their predatory prowess.

        <h2>Hunting and Behavior</h2>
        <p>
          Solitary hunters, eagles execute high-speed dives to capture fish, mammals, and birds. They inhabit varied landscapes—
          forests, mountains, and coasts—often symbolizing freedom. During breeding, pairs form strong bonds, with 2025 studies 
          noting increased pair cooperation in resource-scarce regions.

        <h2>Nesting and Habitat</h2>
        <p>
          Eagles build massive nests in trees or cliffs, reusing them annually—Bald Eagles often return to the same site. They 
          thrive in rugged terrains, from deserts to wetlands, but face habitat loss. May 2025 surveys show nesting sites 
          shrinking due to urbanization and deforestation pressures.

        <h2>Conservation Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Habitat fragmentation, pollution, and hunting threaten eagles, with many species endangered. Conservation efforts in 
          2025 focus on habitat restoration, anti-poaching laws, and pollution control, aiming to safeguard these iconic birds 
          for future generations amid ongoing environmental challenges.
