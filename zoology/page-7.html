        <h2>What Are Pythons?</h2>
        <p>
          Pythons, a group of non-venomous snakes, inhabit Africa, Asia, and Australia. Known for their immense size—up to 33 
          feet and 550 pounds—these constrictors use muscular bodies to subdue prey. As keystone predators, they regulate 
          ecosystems, maintaining balance in their habitats as of May 2025.

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          Pythons feature long, scaled bodies with diamond-shaped heads and small, gripping teeth. Their muscular build enables 
          them to constrict prey, suffocating it before consumption. Adapted for nocturnal hunting, their robust physiology 
          supports survival in diverse climates, from forests to grasslands.

        <h2>Behavior and Ecology</h2>
        <p>
          Solitary and nocturnal, pythons hunt rodents, birds, and larger prey like antelopes. They can survive weeks without 
          food after a meal, showcasing metabolic efficiency. Their role as apex predators helps control prey populations—2025 
          studies highlight their impact on small mammal dynamics.

        <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>
          Revered in many cultures, pythons symbolize wisdom and protection—some African communities worship them as deities. 
          However, this reverence fuels exploitation, with hunting for skins and medicinal use threatening populations. In 2025,
          cultural programs aim to balance reverence with conservation.

        <h2>Conservation Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Habitat loss, hunting, and the pet trade threaten pythons, with non-native introductions disrupting ecosystems. May 
          2025 conservation efforts focus on habitat protection, anti-poaching measures, and research into genetics, aiming to 
          ensure their survival amid ongoing environmental pressures.
