        <h2>What Are Hyenas?</h2>
        <p>
          Hyenas, carnivorous mammals of the Hyaenidae family, include four species: spotted, brown, striped, and aardwolf. 
          Known for their vocalizations and scavenging, they thrive across Africa and parts of Asia, with spotted hyenas 
          dominating sub-Saharan ecosystems as of May 2025.

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          Spotted hyenas, the largest, weigh up to 160 pounds with powerful jaws and spotted coats. Brown hyenas (up to 90 
          pounds) adapt to arid regions, while striped (up to 90 pounds) and aardwolves (up to 30 pounds) feature unique stripes
          and termite-specialized tongues, showcasing diverse adaptations.

        <h2>Social Structure and Behavior</h2>
        <p>
          Spotted hyenas form matriarchal clans with females dominant, using complex vocalizations for coordination. Brown and 
          striped hyenas are solitary scavengers, while aardwolves target termites. In 2025, studies highlight their social 
          bonds aiding survival in fragmented habitats.

        <h2>Ecological Role</h2>
        <p>
          Hyenas regulate herbivore populations through scavenging and predation, maintaining ecosystem balance. Spotted hyenas 
          control prey numbers, while aardwolves manage termite populationsâ€”2025 research notes their role in preventing 
          overgrazing in African savannas.

        <h2>Conservation Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Facing habitat loss, hunting for meat, and cultural stigma, hyenas are threatened. Conservation efforts in May 2025 
          include habitat restoration, anti-poaching, and education to counter misconceptions, ensuring their ecological and 
          cultural significance endures.
