        <h2>What Are King Cobras?</h2>
        <p>
          King cobras (Ophiophagus hannah), the world’s largest venomous snakes, reach 18 feet and over 20 pounds, native to 
          Southeast Asian forests. Their hooded neck and neurotoxic venom make them apex predators as of May 2025.

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          With olive-green to black scales, elongated heads, and expandable hoods, king cobras intimidate with 0.5-inch fangs 
          delivering potent venom. Their muscular bodies enable swift strikes, enhancing their hunting efficiency.

        <h2>Behavior and Diet</h2>
        <p>
          Diurnal and solitary, king cobras hunt rodents, lizards, and other snakes, including venomous species, using keen 
          senses. Males battle for dominance during mating, communicating with hisses—2025 observations note increased 
          territoriality in shrinking habitats.

        <h2>Ecological Role</h2>
        <p>
          As top predators, king cobras control rodent and snake populations, maintaining ecosystem balance. Their predation 
          reduces threats to humans—2025 studies highlight their role in stabilizing prey dynamics in Southeast Asian jungles.

        <h2>Conservation Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Facing habitat loss, hunting, and human conflict, king cobras require urgent conservation. May 2025 efforts focus on 
          habitat protection and anti-poaching, ensuring their ecological and cultural value endures.
