        <h2>Overview of Ecology</h2>
        <p>
          Ecology studies organism-environment interactions, analyzing how these relationships influence species distribution, 
          energy flow, and nutrient cycling across levels from individuals to the biosphere. It provides critical insights into 
          natural systems and human impacts, essential for sustainability in May 2025.

        <h2>Ecosystem Dynamics</h2>
        <p>
          Ecosystems, integrating living organisms with abiotic factors like sunlight and water, rely on energy flow from 
          photosynthesis through food chains and nutrient cycles (carbon, nitrogen) for productivity. Human disruptions,
          such as pollution, challenge these processes, affecting ecosystem health as observed in 2025.

      <section>
        <h2>Population and Community Interactions</h2>
        <p>
          Population ecology examines species group dynamics, focusing on size, density, and growth influenced by birth and 
          death rates, while community ecology explores species interactions like predation, competition, and mutualism. These 
          dynamics, studied in 2025, shape ecosystem stability and biodiversity.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Biodiversity and Conservation</h2>
        <p>
          Biodiversity, encompassing genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity, ensures resilience and supports services like 
          pollination and water purification, yet faces threats from habitat loss and climate change. Conservation efforts in 
          2025 focus on protected areas and sustainable practices to preserve it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Human Impact and Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Human ecology addresses impacts like urbanization and climate change, driven by fossil fuels and deforestation, which 
          alter ecosystems and species distributions. In 2025, ecology informs strategies to mitigate pollution, deforestation, 
          and biodiversity loss, promoting sustainable resource management.
