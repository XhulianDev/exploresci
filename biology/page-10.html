        <h2>Types of Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
          Reproduction, ensuring species continuity, splits into asexual (e.g., binary fission, budding) producing genetically 
          identical offspring, and sexual, involving gamete fusion via meiosis for genetic diversity. These processes, studied 
          extensively by May 2025, drive evolution and adaptation across organisms.

        <h2>Asexual Reproduction Methods</h2>
        <p>
          Asexual reproduction in bacteria uses binary fission, splitting into identical cells, while yeast employs budding, 
          forming new individuals from outgrowths. Fragmentation in starfish and vegetative propagation in
          plants, like runners, also create clones, offering rapid reproduction in stable environments as noted in 2025
          research.

        <h2>Sexual Reproduction and Fertilization</h2>
        <p>
          Sexual reproduction, involving meiosis, produces haploid gametes (sperm, egg) that fuse during fertilization to
          form a diploid zygote, enhancing genetic variation. In animals, gametogenesis in testes and ovaries precedes 
          fertilization in the female tract, initiating development, a focus of 2025 developmental biology.

        <h2>Developmental Stages in Animals</h2>
        <p>
          Animal development progresses through cleavage (forming a blastula), gastrulation (establishing ectoderm, mesoderm, 
          endoderm), organogenesis (organ formation), and growth. These stages, from neural tube to limb development, are
          driven by cellular differentiation, with 2025 studies deepening insights into congenital defects.

        <h2>Plant Reproduction and Growth</h2>
        <p>
          Plants reproduce sexually via pollination and seed formation, or asexually through vegetative propagation, with
          embryo development leading to roots and shoots during germination. Parental care, like mammalian lactation, varies by 
          species, impacting survival, a key area in 2025 ecological research.
