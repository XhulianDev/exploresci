        <h2>Core Principles</h2>
        <p>
          Cell theory, a bedrock of biology, asserts that all living organisms consist of cells, the smallest units capable of 
          life's essential functions, and that cells only arise from pre-existing cells through division. This framework, 
          solidified in the 19th century, underscores the universality of cells across all life forms, from unicellular
          bacteria to multicellular humans, shaping biological research as of May 2025.

        <h2>Historical Development</h2>
        <p>
          Emerging with the microscope's invention in the late 16th century, cell theory evolved through Robert Hooke’s 1665 
          naming of "cells" in cork, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek’s observations of living "animalcules," and the 19th-century work 
          of Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann, who established cells as the universal building blocks of plants and 
          animals. Rudolf Virchow’s 1855 principle of biogenesis further refuted spontaneous generation, cementing cell
          division as the origin of new cells.

        <h2>Functional Significance</h2>
        <p>
          Cells perform critical life processes like metabolism, growth, and reproduction, distinguishing living organisms from 
          non-living matter, while their study reveals mechanisms of cellular communication and homeostasis. In medicine, cell 
          theory underpins disease research, drug development, and vaccine creation by focusing on cellular-level origins of 
          illness, a key focus in 2025 advancements.

        <h2>Modern Advances</h2>
        <p>
          Discoveries like the cell cycle, mitosis, and DNA’s role as genetic material have deepened cell theory’s impact, with 
          tools like electron microscopy and CRISPR-Cas9 enabling precise study of cellular functions. Stem cell research, 
          exploring differentiation, promises regenerative therapies for degenerative diseases, expanding applications in 
          developmental biology by May 2025.

        <h2>Future Implications</h2>
        <p>
          Cell theory continues to drive innovation in biotechnology and medicine, offering insights into life’s complexity and 
          potential treatments for diseases through cellular understanding. As research progresses, it will likely yield
          further breakthroughs, addressing health challenges and enhancing our grasp of biological systems in the coming years.
