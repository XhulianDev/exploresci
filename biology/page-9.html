        <h2>Core Principles</h2>
        <p>
          Molecular biology examines the molecular basis of life, focusing on DNA, RNA, and proteins, and how genetic 
          information flows via the central dogma: DNA to RNA to proteins. This field, pivotal by May 2025, unravels cellular 
          functions, driving advancements in biology and medicine.

        <h2>DNA and Gene Expression</h2>
        <p>
          DNA, a double-helix molecule, encodes genetic instructions through nucleotide sequences (adenine, thymine, cytosine, 
          guanine), transcribed into mRNA by RNA polymerase, then translated into proteins by ribosomes using tRNA. These 
          processes, detailed in 2025 research, are essential for cellular activity and organism development.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Techniques and Tools</h2>
        <p>
          Techniques like PCR amplify DNA, gel electrophoresis separates molecules by size, and recombinant DNA technology 
          enables genetic engineering for GMOs and gene therapy. CRISPR-Cas9, widely used by 2025, allows precise genome
          editing, advancing treatments for genetic disorders like sickle cell anemia.

      <section>
        <h2>Gene Regulation and Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Gene regulation, involving transcription factors and epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation, controls cellular 
          responses and differentiation, critical for development. In medicine, molecular biology informs targeted cancer 
          therapies (e.g., imatinib) and vaccine development, such as mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, a milestone by 2025.
        </p>

        <h2>Impact and Future Prospects</h2>
        <p>
          Molecular biology revolutionizes health through personalized medicine, next-generation sequencing, and insights into 
          infectious diseases, while also enhancing biotechnology. As of May 2025, its ongoing exploration promises innovative 
          therapies and deeper understanding of lifeâ€™s molecular underpinnings.
