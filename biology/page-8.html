        <h2>Overview of Microbiology</h2>
        <p>
          Microbiology studies microorganisms like bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and algae, which are invisible to the 
          naked eye, spanning fields such as bacteriology and virology. These organisms, ubiquitous across diverse
          environments, are vital to ecosystems, health, and industries like medicine and biotechnology, as understood in
          May 2025.

        <h2>Bacteria and Fungi</h2>
        <p>
          Bacteriology examines bacteria, prokaryotes classified by shape (cocci, bacilli) and Gram staining, impacting
          nutrient cycling and human health through probiotics or pathogens like tuberculosis. Mycology studies fungi,
          including yeasts and molds, which decompose matter, produce antibiotics like penicillin, and form symbiotic plant 
          relationships, though some cause infections.
        </p>

        <h2>Viruses and Parasites</h2>
        <p>
          Virology focuses on viruses, acellular agents that replicate in host cells, causing diseases like influenza or HIV, 
          necessitating antiviral drugs and vaccines. Parasitology explores protozoa and helminths causing malaria or 
          schistosomiasis, with 2025 research emphasizing antiparasitic strategies and sanitation to curb their tropical 
          prevalence.

        <h2>Algae and Microbial Ecology</h2>
        <p>
          Phycology studies algae, photosynthetic primary producers in aquatic ecosystems, used in biofuels and wastewater 
          treatment, while microbial ecology examines microbiomes, like the human gutâ€™s, influencing health. Dysbiosis links to 
          diseases like obesity, a growing focus in 2025 microbiome research.

        <h2>Advances and Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Techniques like PCR and metagenomics enhance microbial detection, while antimicrobial resistance, driven by
          antibiotic misuse, poses a public health crisis, requiring new drugs and stewardship. In May 2025, microbiology
          drives innovations in diagnostics, environmental sustainability, and disease management.
