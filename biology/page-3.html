        <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
        <p>
          Evolution and natural selection are foundational biological principles explaining life’s diversity and adaptation, 
          with evolution describing species change over time and natural selection favoring traits that enhance survival and 
          reproduction under environmental pressures. Developed by Charles Darwin in the 19th century, this theory highlights 
          how genetic variation drives the gradual transformation of populations, a key focus in May 2025 studies.

        <h2>Evidence from Observations</h2>
        <p>
          Darwin’s Galápagos finch studies revealed beak adaptations to diet, supporting evolution via natural selection, where 
          advantageous traits like improved camouflage or resilience increase reproductive success. The fossil record, 
          comparative anatomy (e.g., homologous limb structures), and molecular genetics (DNA similarities) further corroborate 
          these processes, with 2025 research refining these connections.

        <h2>Mechanisms and Adaptation</h2>
        <p>
          Genetic mutations and recombination introduce variation, with beneficial mutations—like polar bear fur for insulation 
          or desert plant water conservation—enhancing survival through natural selection across generations. Speciation arises 
          from isolated populations facing divergent pressures, leading to new species, a dynamic explored in 2025 ecological 
          models.

        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Natural selection underpins agriculture through selective breeding for crop yield and livestock traits, while 
          conservation biology uses evolutionary insights to preserve genetic diversity in endangered species. In medicine, it 
          explains antibiotic resistance in bacteria and informs disease management, with 2025 advancements enhancing these 
          applications.

        <h2>Broad Implications</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond biology, evolution influences psychology by exploring behavior’s adaptive roots, anthropology by tracing human 
          origins, and sociology by linking cultural evolution to biological factors. This interdisciplinary impact, studied in 
          2025, deepens our understanding of life’s complexity and humanity’s place in the natural world.
