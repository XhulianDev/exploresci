        <h2>Overview of Processes</h2>
        <p>
          Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are vital biochemical processes that sustain life by facilitating energy flow 
          in ecosystems, with photosynthesis capturing sunlight to create organic molecules and cellular respiration breaking 
          them down for cellular energy. These interconnected processes, studied extensively by May 2025, underpin lifeâ€™s
          energy dynamics.

        <h2>Photosynthesis Mechanics</h2>
        <p>
          In chloroplasts, chlorophyll absorbs light for the light-dependent reactions in thylakoid membranes, producing
          ATP and NADPH via an electron transport chain, while splitting water releases oxygen. The Calvin cycle in the stroma 
          uses these products to fix carbon dioxide into glucose, fueling plant growth and storage, a process refined in 2025 
          research.

        <h2>Cellular Respiration Stages</h2>
        <p>
          Cellular respiration, occurring in mitochondria, includes glycolysis in the cytoplasm (breaking glucose into
          pyruvate), the Krebs cycle in the matrix (generating NADH and FADH2), and oxidative phosphorylation in the inner 
          membrane, where electron transport drives ATP synthesis via chemiosmosis, with oxygen as the final electron acceptor, 
          forming water.

        <h2>Interconnectedness and Global Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Photosynthesis produces oxygen and glucose, which cellular respiration uses to generate ATP, releasing carbon dioxide 
          for photosynthesis, forming a balanced cycle crucial to the global carbon cycle. This interplay, regulating 
          atmospheric gases, supports climate stability, a key ecological focus in 2025 studies.

        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding these processes enhances agriculture by optimizing crop photosynthesis, informs bioenergy through 
          sustainable fuel research, and aids medicine by addressing metabolic disorders like cancer. In May 2025, these 
          insights drive innovations in food security, renewable energy, and health solutions.
