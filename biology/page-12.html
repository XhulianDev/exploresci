        <h2>Core Ethical Principles</h2>
        <p>
          Ethics in biology addresses moral implications of research, guided by principles like autonomy (informed consent), 
          beneficence (maximizing benefits), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), and justice (equitable resource distribution). 
          These ensure scientific progress aligns with societal values, a priority in May 2025.

      <section>
        <h2>Animal Research Ethics</h2>
        <p>
          Animal research ethics, governed by the "Three Rs" (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement), minimizes animal use and 
          ensures humane treatment, balancing scientific needs with welfare concerns. In 2025, these guidelines remain central 
          to ethical debates in biological studies involving animals.

      <section>
        <h2>Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering</h2>
        <p>
          Genetic engineering, especially via CRISPR-Cas9, raises concerns over "designer babies," long-term effects, and
          social inequalities, while GMOs spark debates on environmental safety and biodiversity. These issues, prominent in 
          2025, demand careful ethical scrutiny to mitigate risks.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Synthetic Biology Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Synthetic biology, creating novel organisms, poses ethical questions about life’s nature, environmental risks, and 
          moral responsibility. As of May 2025, this field’s growth underscores the need for robust ethical frameworks to 
          address potential ecological impacts.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Public Health and Global Justice</h2>
        <p>
          Bioethics in public health focuses on equitable healthcare access, addressing disparities, and balancing individual 
          rights with collective needs during pandemics. In 2025, these principles guide global health strategies, ensuring
          fair distribution of biological advancements.
