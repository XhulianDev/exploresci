        <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
        <p>
          Biotechnology uses living organisms to enhance human life, agriculture, and industry, while genetic engineering 
          directly modifies DNA for desired traits. These fields, pivotal by May 2025, leverage techniques like recombinant DNA 
          to innovate across medicine and environmental science.

        <h2>Genetic Engineering Techniques</h2>
        <p>
          Genetic engineering involves isolating genes, inserting them into vectors like plasmids, and using host cells
          (e.g., E. coli) to express traits, producing GMOs like Bt corn for pest resistance. CRISPR-Cas9, a precise editing 
          tool, enables targeted DNA changes, advancing research by 2025.

        <h2>Medical and Agricultural Applications</h2>
        <p>
          In medicine, genetic engineering creates therapeutic proteins (e.g., insulin) and gene therapies for disorders, while 
          in agriculture, GMOs enhance crop yields and resilience. Tissue culture supports plant propagation, with 2025 
          innovations boosting food security and healthcare outcomes.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Environmental and Industrial Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Biotechnology aids environmental protection through bioremediation, using engineered microbes to clean pollutants,
          and industrial applications like biofuels from algae. Synthetic biology designs novel biological systems, promoting 
          sustainability, a key focus in 2025 industrial advancements.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Ethical and Regulatory Considerations</h2>
        <p>
          Ethical debates around GMOs, gene editing, and environmental risks prompt regulatory oversight by agencies like the 
          FDA, ensuring safety and efficacy. As of May 2025, balancing innovation with responsible use remains critical to 
          address societal and ecological concerns.
