        <h2>Fundamentals of Genetics</h2>
        <p>
          Genetics studies the molecular mechanisms of inheritance, with genes—DNA segments encoding proteins—as the core
          units, while heredity describes trait transmission across generations. The genome, an organism’s complete gene set, 
          governs its biology, impacting fields like medicine and agriculture through insights into genetic disorders and crop 
          enhancement, as understood in May 2025.

        <h2>Historical Foundations</h2>
        <p>
          Gregor Mendel, dubbed the "father of genetics," established heredity’s principles in the 19th century via pea plant 
          experiments, introducing laws of segregation and independent assortment for allele distribution. The 1953 discovery
          of DNA’s double helix by Watson, Crick, Franklin, and Wilkins revealed how nucleotides (A, T, C, G) store and 
          replicate genetic information, ensuring accurate transmission during cell division.

        <h2>Inheritance Patterns</h2>
        <p>
          Mendelian inheritance involves single-gene traits with dominant or recessive alleles, while non-Mendelian patterns 
          like incomplete dominance, codominance, and polygenic inheritance (e.g., height) show complexity. Mutations, 
          spontaneous or environmentally induced, drive evolution by providing beneficial traits for natural selection, also 
          causing genetic diseases like cystic fibrosis, a focus of 2025 research.

        <h2>Modern Advances</h2>
        <p>
          Technologies like DNA sequencing, propelled by the 2003 Human Genome Project, enable personalized medicine, tailoring 
          treatments to genetic profiles, while CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing advances agriculture and medical therapies. These
          tools, widely used by 2025, allow precise genetic manipulation, addressing diseases and enhancing crop resilience, 
          transforming biological applications across industries.

        <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
        <p>
          Genetic advancements raise ethical concerns, including privacy, discrimination, and the morality of gene editing or 
          cloning, necessitating a balance between benefits and risks. As of May 2025, these debates shape how society
          navigates genetics, ensuring responsible use while exploring its potential to deepen our understanding of life’s 
          diversity and continuity.
