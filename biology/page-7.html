        <h2>Overview of Disciplines</h2>
        <p>
          Human anatomy and physiology investigate the body's structure and function, from cells to organ systems, providing 
          foundational knowledge for medical science. These fields, critical for healthcare advancements as of May 2025, reveal 
          how the body sustains life and responds to challenges like disease.

        <h2>Anatomical Structures</h2>
        <p>
          Anatomy includes gross anatomy (e.g., skeletal, muscular, and nervous systems), histology (studying epithelial, 
          connective, muscle, and nervous tissues), and embryology (tracking development from egg to organism). These branches 
          highlight how structures like bones for support and muscles for movement are organized, a focus of 2025 studies.

      <section>
        <h2>Physiological Functions</h2>
        <p>
          Physiology examines cellular processes (e.g., metabolism, signaling) and system functions, such as the cardiovascular 
          system’s blood circulation and the respiratory system’s gas exchange. Pathophysiology explores disease impacts, 
          guiding treatments for conditions like heart disease, with 2025 research enhancing these insights.
        </p>

        <h2>System Integration</h2>
        <p>
          Anatomy and physiology interlink, as seen in the lungs’ alveoli enabling efficient gas exchange or the heart’s design 
          for pumping blood, while the nervous and endocrine systems coordinate via signals and hormones. This synergy
          maintains homeostasis, a key area of 2025 medical advancements.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Technological Advances and Applications</h2>
        <p>
          Imaging like MRI and CT scans, alongside molecular biology, deepen anatomical and physiological understanding,
          driving innovations in diagnostics and treatments for disorders like Parkinson’s. In May 2025, these fields continue 
          to improve healthcare, supporting better disease management and prevention strategies.
