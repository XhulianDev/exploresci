        <h2>Overview of Homeostasis</h2>
        <p>
          Homeostasis is the process by which living organisms maintain a stable internal environment despite external changes, 
          ensuring survival through regulation of factors like temperature and pH. This dynamic equilibrium, critical to all 
          life forms, relies on feedback mechanisms and is a key focus in biological research as of May 2025.

        <h2>Regulatory Mechanisms</h2>
        <p>
          Homeostasis involves negative feedback loops, where sensors detect deviations (e.g., body temperature rise), 
          triggering responses like sweating to cool down, and positive feedback loops, amplifying processes like blood
          clotting. These mechanisms, studied with advanced techniques in 2025, maintain balance in systems such as the 
          endocrine and nervous systems.

        <h2>Key Controlled Variables</h2>
        <p>
          Essential variables like blood glucose levels are regulated by insulin and glucagon, while hydration is managed 
          through kidney function and hormone signals like ADH. Temperature control via shivering or vasodilation exemplifies 
          how organisms adapt, with 2025 research enhancing our understanding of these physiological adjustments.

        <h2>Impact of Disruptions</h2>
        <p>
          Homeostatic imbalances, such as diabetes from poor glucose regulation or hypothermia from temperature loss,
          can lead to disease or death if unchecked. Environmental stressors like pollution, a concern in 2025, challenge these 
          systems, driving studies into resilience and therapeutic interventions.

        <h2>Ecological and Medical Relevance</h2>
        <p>
          Homeostasis supports ecosystem stability by enabling organism survival under varying conditions, while in medicine,
          it informs treatments for disorders like hypertension or metabolic diseases. In May 2025, ongoing research leverages 
          this knowledge for innovative healthcare and conservation strategies.
